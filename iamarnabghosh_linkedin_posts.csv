"3 RULES OF A CONTENT AUDIT:

üí° A content audit allows you to choose what content on your website to delete/redirect, what to update, and what to leave alone.

This insanely helpful process can significantly increase your traffic, if done right.

üü£ RULE #1: BE RUTHLESS.

Google literally just released an update they named the ‚ÄúHelpful Content Update.‚Äù

If a page isn‚Äôt helpful, isn‚Äôt ranking, and doesn‚Äôt offer another kind of value (e.g., your privacy policy), then cut it.

This is not your baby. It is a website.

(And if it WAS a baby, think of that page like the poo-poo from a particularly nasty diapey. üß∑üí©üë∂üèº)

üü£ RULE #2: USE MULTIPLE TOOLS.

Using a combination of GA, GSC, and a tool like Ahrefs will give you the best picture of the traffic coming to a page, how it gets there, and what organic search value it offers.

I once recommended a website remove 18 of their 20 ‚Äúblog posts.‚Äù These pages didn‚Äôt rank for anything, were pretty unhelpful (educationally), and were all very same-y.

I also didn‚Äôt have GA access, only GSC.

As it turns out, those were PPC landing pages that performed well for a specific audience.

We kept the pages, but we moved them out of the blog and de-indexed them from search to make way for better content.

Another reason more tools is a helpful option: GSC and Ahrefs often show me completely divergent data for specific keywords.

A keyword for which Ahrefs flags zero search volume might be bringing in hundreds of thousands of impressions, but in a position too low to get many clicks.

Rather than cutting it due to limited data, you‚Äôll be able to see the value of optimizing that page.

üü£ RULE #3: DON‚ÄôT OVERDO THE WORK.

My first go-around at this was at an in-house editor job.

I wayyyy overdid it ‚Äî I thought that every post we wanted to keep needed to be fully rewritten, essentially from scratch.

It was a MASSIVE waste of time.

Some of those posts just needed simpler sentences, better PAA answers, relevant graphics, and snappier titles.

Especially for posts that are underperforming but get *some* organic traffic, consider smaller changes first before spending hours on unnecessary work.

"90% of the websites on the internet aren't linking their own pages together in the right way.

Most people just interlink random stuff on their website and call it a day.

Internal linking is a way to tell Google where to look for related information.

But there's one thing that most people never talk about.

Google filed a patent related to a system that checks the ""rank"" of the page that's pointing the link towards another page.

In short, Google has a mechanism to see if a Page A that's linking to another Page B is trustworthy, authoritative in that niche, and closely related to the webpage it's pointing at.

This is the reason why internal linking is such an easy, and extremely valuable SEO win.

You should link your articles together in a way that helps Google understand what the other page is about.

So, here are some actionable tips you can apply to your content network right now.

* Think of internal linking like citing resources. You wouldn't cite a resource in a research piece if it doesn't help prove your point.

* Don't use keywords while linking your article. Try to explain what the linked page is about. For example, if you're writing an article on Keto Diet, and you already have a page related to weight loss, use an anchor like ""scientifically proven methods for weight loss"" instead of ""weight loss"".

* Think of where you want to take Google from your article. If you're talking about a product, link the product in that article.

* Don't try to shove links for the sake of ""internal linking"". If you want to get it right, keep it natural.

When you're writing, just think about ""proving your point"".

Anything that supports your claim will be a good linking structure.

Everything else is just noise.

"I increased this e-commerce site's traffic by 400% without backlinks and technical SEO.

I couldn't post the transactional increase, but it has also tripled over the past 6 months.

Nope! This isn't clickbait.

I put 0 efforts in making backlinks.

I didn't focus on Core Web Vitals.

I forgot about meta descriptions (except for the blogs).

All I did was execute a Semantic SEO strategy which worked like a charm.

I'll give you my exact strategy so you can do the same for your business:

Note: Your site should have at least some authority for this strategy to work. If it's very new, you'll need to invest in an off page strategy.

* Audit the content of your website. See if you've written anything that's not a good fit for your niche and delete it.

* Make categories for your content. Every piece you've ever written or will write should have a parent category.

* Be very mindful of your internal linking strategy. Link your articles and your products that are closely related to each other.

* Write content on the products you've featured on your site. Just Google your product to see what ""others are asking"" and go from there.

* Every article you write should link back to the parent category's URL and every parent category's URL should link back to the product related to it.

* For each product, cover every question that people are asking related to it. Link them together, and the product you're selling on your website.

That's how you'll make a semantic content network.

A network that will eventually cover almost every keyword's search intent.

Just be mindful of the anchors you choose for your internal links.

Don't try to fit in keywords there.

Cover the search intent by explaining what the linked page is.

"How to create a Buyer's persona?
.
No! No! You already know that! There's a lot of content out there for the same.

Let me rephrase the question!
You're working in B2B, and there's more than one persona!

How do you go about targeting them?

Now things get a bit haywire, doesn't it?

I've been confused for a long time asking people this question!

Now that I've somewhat clear idea about it,

I've tried to answer this question for you in my latest article.

I'm sure you'll love this one. :D

"I feel reading marketing blogs won't teach you marketing for early-stage startups.

Atleast I haven't seen any blog which specifically answers my problems.

Most of the blogs I read, talks about marketing for established companies- not how to do marketing from scratch.

What do you think?
