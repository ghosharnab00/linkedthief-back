"NO child can grow up around so many books and NOT turn into an original thinker and extraordinary writer…

This is my home library in Mumbai (minus the 500+ books we have given away over the years.)

Growing up, I’ve seen my dad read a new book EVERY SINGLE DAY, for years. He would sit for 3-4 hours at a stretch with a pencil in one hand, and finish reading the book cover-to-cover.

Classics, history, historical fiction, anatomy, business, sci-fi, poetry - you name it, he has read it.

While staring at the shelf last night, I realised: I understand now that having books in the house is a must.

It is the duty of parents to bring tons of books into the house every year.

It is the duty of parents to read new books in front of their children and set a good example, without having to force their children to read.

It is the duty of parents to spark conversations about their new learnings at the dinner table daily.

It’s the duty of parents to buy books for their children - even if they don’t read them yet. Buy them a variety over time and let them discover their interests by trial and error.

As a final note:

I have read barely 5 books from my dad’s collection.

But what I HAVE done over the years is: Flipped through most of these books and read a few pages of whichever part caught my attention.

This random habit has - subconsciously- had a huge influence on my writing style, skills, ideas and interests.

May more kids grow up with books around them ❤️

"What if motivation and discipline, both, fail?

There's something strange about returning to work after a long Diwali weekend. At this point, not only is the month almost over, but the year is also almost over... and our goals start getting pushed to the 1st of January.

The motivation to get things done tends to fade away slowly...

And that's when discipline comes in.

In fact, I've always said that discipline >>> motivation. You do what you've got to do regardless of how you feel about it, and you keep things moving. Simple.

But, what if discipline fails too?

What if you're just not able to get yourself to move?

What if nothing feels right and any action feels worthless?

What if you feel it's easier to give up on your goals than it is to put in the work towards achieving it?

What then?

What do you do when motivation and discipline, both, FAIL?

Then, you rely on this secret third state of mind: PRESSURE.

You have to start thinking about everything that will happen when you DON'T put in the work:

> I'll lose my clients
> I'll lose followers and leads
> I'll lose all of my progress so far
> I'll have to start from zero all over again...

Sometimes, you have to let your fears attack you and pressurise you.

Because when motivation and discipline fail, it's PRESSURE that keeps you afloat and going (and non-broke). Learn to leverage this pressure tactically.

What do you do when motivation and discipline fail?

#ShreyaWrites

Wishing everyone a Happy Diwali! 🪔 Hope you had a wonderful celebration and are all set to get back to your wholesome hustle :)

"If you are scared of creating content because 'everything has already been said', I dare you to write 1 LinkedIn post and publish the same thing 2 times a week, for 2 weeks. You’ll see many new people engage with it each time, and you’ll see little-to-no people complain about the repetition.

This is also why I (need to) keep repeating my catchphrase freelancing advice - Charge in advance :)

"16th July 2022 - I flew from Dubai to Bangalore to shoot my first course “Going Freelance”.

And today, I am so excited to share with you - my course is now available for preorder!

A huge thanks to Arvind Arora and the Conker World Team for making me feel so at home during my time in Bangalore, and for making the creation of this course a fun learning experience.

Special thanks to the Conker Team - Dr.Prutha Bhardwaj, Anand Kumar, Daniel Raj, Shubhankar Storyteller, Prathamesh V., Meenakshi Rawat, Ananya Kamal, Aakash and Royal.

"Nowadays I open LinkedIn, read a post from a freelancer, and think ""Wow, that looks like something I would have written!""

Then I realise, that was indeed something I'd written.
Perhaps a month ago; a year ago; or even 3 years ago.

Sad to see so many freelancers promising ""original content"" for their clients while stealing their own.

Anyway, at least plagiarism is proving my content is eternal :)

"""What's the logical thinking behind younger generations choosing a ₹15k-per-month freelancing role over a ₹50k-per-month full-time job?""

Udit Goenka asked this thought-provoking question in a tweet recently.

Here's my response:

Full-time yr 1: ₹50k per month
Full-time yr 2: ₹60k per month
Full-time yr 3: ₹70k per month

(^ I’m overestimating here)

Freelancing yr 1: ₹15k per month
Freelancing yr 2: ₹1 Lac per month
Freelancing yr 3: ₹1.5 Lac per month per client

(^ I’m underestimating here)

The logical and rational thinking here is the POTENTIAL.

Yes, you'll likely earn more initially in a job compared to as a freelancer. But your career and financial growth in a job are fixed...

Freelancing though? Limitless potential. 

Could be earning x one month and 3x the next. 
Could also drop down to 0.2x after that, and then go up to 10x.

Forget the money, there is also a thrill, a challenge in freelancing.

There's a constant battle between freedom and self-discipline; 
between getting comfortable and pushing your limits; 
between working for fixed hours a day and staying up all night for a passion project.

Not everyone can afford the thrill/ the challenge of course.

Yet there is something so exciting about the ""Let's see what's the best I can do here"" thought process.

It's not surprising that many end up freelancing along with their job.

Let's not forget this:

You get kicked out of a job? You're jobless for weeks. Months. You have no source of income.

A client lets you go as a freelancer? You already have 3 more. And you know exactly how to make money online by yourself. You'll get another source of income.

And of course, why are YOUNGER GENERATIONS preferring freelancing?

Because time and freedom >>> money.

When you have time, you can upskill
You can spend time with your family
You can create content online
You can build an audience
You can sleep well
You can be fit
You can live.

This is also in line with the concept of the ""Time Billionaire.”

Wouldn't you, at your age of 18-25, rather be the broke you that you are, than the 70-year-old billionaire?

Why? Because you are young.

You have energy
You have time
You are ""alive"" in ways that a 70yo billionaire isn't.

This is ALSO in line with the concept of ""I didn't want to work a 9-5 so I became an entrepreneur and now I work 24x7…”

The number of hours of work doesn't matter when you're doing what YOU want to do, in YOUR own way.

In conclusion:

Preferring freelancing/ self-employment is a more logical decision by youngsters than preferring full-time employment. Regardless of the money and time involved.

It's obvious:
There is no better time to take risks than when you are young.

Take risks.

"In August, I made up my mind to get out of my slump. Put in the work in ALL aspects possible:

- Posting content intentionally
- Being active with inbound DMs (I don't do much outreach anyway)
- Consuming the right kind of content
- Hiring people (& making quick firing decisions)
- Sleeping well
- Eating right
- Working out
- Learning how to sing a new song
- Getting out of the house often…

But I think the most important thing here is this:
I did not give up the ""normal, everyday"" life while building my business.

I did everything I wanted to do and should have done.

In fact, I think doing everything pushed me towards maximising what ""limited"" time I had for working on my business.

Like I've said before:

The ""hustle"" lies not in working hard, but in working towards EVERY SINGLE THING you should be doing for yourself every single day.

The ‘wholesome hustle’ pays off ❤️

What does your 'wholesome hustle' look like?

"Every piece of writing advice I could come up with in 15 minutes, after writing for 10+ years: (Yes, I've been writing for over a DECADE)

1. Write like you talk, but edit like every single word will cost you $5

2. Stop researching as you write

3. Stop spellchecking as you write

4. Stop editing as you write

5. Sit down to write every day regardless of your mood

6. 30 minutes a day is all you need to improve your writing

7. Write the conclusion first so you know where you're headed

8. Write the introduction last, summarising everything

9. Prefer active voice over passive voice

10. Don’t stress over the order. Write one line here, one line there - be random

11. Format it well and make your writing LOOK aesthetically appealing

12. When editing, ask yourself “So what?” after every sentence. Can’t answer the question? Edit/ delete the sentence

13. Kill your darlings

14. Don’t report. Narrate

15. Skip the jargon - a 10yo should understand what you write

16. Don’t write and edit on the same day

17. Delete adverbs

18. Write with ONE person in mind. Write ""TO"" them

19. Write every day

20. Write anything you want - journals, poems, essays, tweets, songs. Just write

21. Set writing goals - could be time (30 mins daily), milestone (1 chapter), or word count (500 words)

22. If you think too fast and write too slow, use an app like Otter to transcribe your audio to text; edit later

23. Use Hemingway Editor to check the readability quotient of your writing. Aim for Grade 3 - Grade 5

24. No amount of reading will help you improve your writing, unless you write more than you read

25. Emulate the writing style of your favourite writers to improve yours

26. Write early in the morning or late at night

27. Pick a platform and publish something every day

28. When learning how to write, quantity > quality

29. If your writing isn’t improving, you’re not writing enough

30. You don't need a critic to tell you you're getting better at writing; you'll feel it yourself

31. The easiest way to enjoy writing is to write something you WANT to write about. It could be something personal, write it down anyway

32. Don’t expect instant results. Writing is not “just words”

33. Don’t pause to erase mistakes. Just strike them off and keep writing

This advice may look ""simple"", but read it again and ask yourself - how many of these do you follow?

Not enough, I bet.

So think of the advice being ""simple"" as a good thing - You can apply it instantly, and ""effortlessly.""

"What if Virat Kohli did only cardio in the gym, and had no in-field cricket training? Would he be one of the best cricket players we've seen?

No, of course not.

Virat Kohli NEEDS in-field training.

That's how I feel about the idea of ""doing an internship to gain experience as a freelancer...""

Yes, internships *might* help you learn the work itself, eg, social media management or article writing, etc. [Like I can be seen doing in the picture below...]

But those things make up only 5-10% of a successful freelancing career. 

Freelancing relies heavily (90-95%) on things that are not part of an internship:

• Lead generation
• Closing clients
• Personal branding
• Conducting sales calls
• Persuasion & proposals
• Setting terms & conditions
• Creating offers & setting prices
• Working with new people regularly
• Managing client concerns and issues...

You can't expect internships to teach you all these aspects of freelancing.

Freelancing is freelancing, and it requires hands-on experience in well... freelancing!

Now, you can still choose to take up an internship to learn how to do a particular task. 

However, consider whether you want to take up the 40+ hours a week of stress and extra time involvement (eg. travel) that comes with an internship, or instead use that time to learn to freelance as soon as possible.

Bottom line:

If you want to be a freelancer, start freelancing.

"“You could have saved a lot of money by living at home but you moved to Dubai and you call it an investment. In what way exactly is moving to Dubai an investment for you?”

Many people have asked me this question since I moved to Dubai this February.

From the monetary perspective… Here’s how I have found my environment to influence financial growth:

When I started freelancing, I was studying in Dublin, Ireland (That’s my university in the picture.)

At the time, making €500 a month as a beginner was a huge thing. I thought “Wow this is probably higher than what a job would pay me…”

So I was very happy with what I was earning.

But then I realised, €500 is nothing in Dublin. My monthly rent itself was double of that. Plus I had living expenses. Plus I had college fees.

My parents were sponsoring my education, but I wanted to contribute towards easing this out.

So I HAD to earn more.

🎯 My first goal was to pay my daily expenses myself. The initial €500 covered that.

🎯 Then I made a goal to pay my rent.
+ €1000 a month. I did it.

🎯 Then I made a goal to pay my tuition.
+€22,000 a year. I did it.

The point is: If I didn’t have all those motivations (ahem ahem, expenses) to push me towards earning more, I would have never tested my limits.

🫶🏻 That’s what I mean by moving to another city/ country - that time Dublin, this time Dubai - being an “investment.”

The benefits and results come in various forms and ways, and this was mine when I was in Ireland.

I cannot pinpoint how my new environment will help me, but this is how my environment pushed me in the past.

‼️ This post isn’t about moving abroad; or even about moving at all. It’s about getting out of your comfort zone, finding encouragement in certain challenges, and doing your best for yourself.

I hope this helps :)

"Do you want your stories to go viral but fear the toxicity that may come with it?

LinkedIn is an excellent platform for content creation that is known for its high organic reach.

But this high organic reach often comes with gaining massive engagement on posts, which also means a fair share of trolls/ nasty comments...

If you are new to creating content on LinkedIn and find the possible toxicity nerve-wracking, here are some ways to overcome that fear:

#1. Follow the proven, ""cliche"" writing style without fear of judgment. Your story is YOUR story; you don't need to try and reinvent the wheel with how you say it.

#2. Be honest in your writing and realise that you don’t owe anyone any justification.

#3. Anticipate follow-up questions, and be prepared for these comments BEFORE you hit ‘publish.’

#4. Avoid words that may dilute your key message, or take the reader off on a tangent. Edit ruthlessly.

#5. The trolls will exist, but they will also remain in tiny numbers when your success is big. Focus on the big picture; on the good stuff.

#6. Ignore, block or mute the trolls and the argumentative/ toxic comments, and engage only with the ones that will add value to your post. 

#7. If you are new to LinkedIn and get high engagement on your posts, avoid reading the comments (until you know can learn to ignore negative comments.)

#8. Move on to writing your next post. Your audience is waiting!

Do you still fear hitting “Publish” on LinkedIn?

"One of my friends is a doctor. He has NO need for my ebooks, yet he buys them full-price on the launch day itself.

Another friend of mine is an architect. She has little need for my content, yet she reads 100s of my Instagram stories where I answer freelancing questions weekly.

My grandfather does not need to keep up with my content either, yet he reads every single LinkedIn post, Instagram Story, and tweet of mine, every single day.

My mom loves my Instagram and keeps a check on my follower count. Every time I hit a new round figure milestone (68K, 69K, 70K...), she sends me a screenshot with a heart ❤️ drawn around the number (as you can see in the picture below.)

My dad says ""Ok"" instantly to any last-minute help I ask from him, including help with research for my Twitter threads, and with refining any of my writing that I am doubtful of...

In its own unique way, my journey as an entrepreneur is a team effort.

And I couldn't be more grateful for a team like this.

"""Shreya, how do you maintain work-life balance?""

Well... I don't.

In fact, I think work-life balance is a myth. And chasing work-life balance is a run towards nothing.

I mean, think about it: Do we ever talk about ""Love - Life"" balance?

""Health - Life"" balance?

""Family - Life"" balance?

""Happiness - Life"" balance?

""Relationship - Life"" balance?

""Mental health - Life"" balance?

No.

Why not?

Well, I can think of 3 reasons:

#1. Because these are not terms that are fed to us regularly by media, unlike the term ""work-life balance.""

#2. Because we understand that each of these things has its ups and downs.

​We don't try to ""balance"" things out when it comes to health, relationships, family or happiness. We understand that these elements are not in our control, and we will ride a new wave every day with them.
​
It is only in the ups and downs of work that we freak out the most.

We think that if something is NOT going right work-wise, then we have made some intentional mistake that now needs to be brought back to balance.

We think that if something IS going well work-wise, then we should pause and slow down and focus on the other things in life too to create the right balance. Both these approaches then hinder our growth for unworthy reasons.

#3. Because these terms just sound absurd.

​Love - Life balance, Health - Life balance... umm, what? That's absurd.

​After all, what even is life without health - physical & mental, family, and relationships? We simply cannot segregate these things from ""life."" Otherwise, how do we even define life?

The same holds true for work. Work is not life in itself, yet work is a large chunk of it. There is more to life than work, yet work is a huge part of life. And life cannot be defined without work.


So yes, I don't aim for ""work-life balance.""

I only aim to live a fulfilling life, where I am able to create time to work on what I love and enjoy, every day :)

What's your idea of ""work-life balance”?

The list is long but I don’t use each tool every single day.

My go-to daily tools are:

Zoom
Canva

Airtable app
Google Drive

"The fear of self-investment:

For newbies, when it comes to financial (especially stock market & crypto) investment, one of our main concern is the uncertainty of rate of returns.

It’s the uncertainty of when returns may come, and the uncertainty of protection of principal.

(We have no guarantee that we won’t even lose the amount of money we have invested, let alone guarantee a positive RoI.)

I think the same happens for investing in oneself too.

We may fear investing in ourselves wholeheartedly - could be education, business, health, recreational activities - because we don’t know what returns our investment will bring and when they will bring us the returns.

However, there is one stark difference between both kinds of investments - Control.

In the first kind of investment, you are at the mercy of factors beyond your control (no control over the stock market or crypto market).

In self-investment though, you have full control over the actions you take, and hence have a modicum of control over the results you generate. Also, your learnings can transmute and bring a positive RoI in other areas of your life.

This is why I think that people who stop investing in themselves do it because they feel they are not in control, and so they don't trust themselves to invest in themselves.

They don’t trust themselves to take the responsibility to improve upon themselves; to keep themselves accountable; to take the action they know they need to take.

And because of this, they fear the failure that they know they are guaranteeing for themselves.

Don’t be this person.

Invest in yourself.

And work towards getting the RoI you aim to accrue.

"I wasn’t planning on posting this thread here (I leave some topics & thoughts exclusively for Twitter)

But this thread quickly became one of my best-performing threads on Twitter… 230,000+ impressions.

So many people resonated with what I have said here, and that’s a bittersweet thing.

I wanted this thread to be read by as many young people as possible, so I am glad this thread picked up on Twitter.

Yet, I want even more people to see it.

Especially because this idea stems from personal experience, and in-person conversations I have had with many 16-22yos over the last 2 weeks of my travel.

So now this thread is up on LinkedIn as well.

I hope it can help you.
And if you do find it helpful, please share the post.

Comment any questions.

"When you lack boundaries as a freelancer,

You lack the FRAME it requires to turn a work relationship

From working FOR your clients

To working WITH your clients.

When you lose that frame, you allow clients too much leverage over you, your time and your mental peace.

"9 simple writing tips that you can apply in the next 5 minutes to improve your writing forever:

[#8 is the tip you never knew you needed]

1. Turn off spellcheck while you’re writing - you won’t get distracted by the red underlines.

2. Keep 1 person in mind while writing anything, and write only for them.

3. Make writing a part of your daily routine - it could be a goal to write x words every day, or to write for x minutes every day - up to you.

4. If you think faster than you write and that affects the quality, then use an app like Otter to transcribe your audio to text; edit later.

5. You don’t need to start writing from the beginning (in fact, you shouldn't) - write in any random order that suits you and piece things together later.

6. Write your conclusion first, so you have clarity on what point you need to make through the rest of the piece and you can reverse-engineer it.

7. Write your introduction last, so you can accurately summarise the rest of the piece while creating a build-up to read it all.

8. Write like you talk, but edit like every single word is going to cost you $5.

9. Use Hemingway Editor to check the readability quotient of your writing, and aim to achieve a level of Grade 3 - Grade 5.

"14 things I wish I knew before I started freelancing:

[3, 10, and 14 are my favourites]

1. Stop trying to look only at revenue as a freelancer. Freelance to add value; revenue will follow.

2. If you want to make more sales, study concepts from both, psychology and marketing.

3. Don’t be afraid of scaling too fast. You don’t need to struggle and toil for years to hit $10K months. You can do it in under a year.

4. Regular content creation will get you 3-5 leads a day, in under a year. Want to get leads in your sleep? Create content.

5. Don’t rely only on content creation for lead generation. Use other methods too, especially some form of outbound.

6. You don’t need a degree, or rather any work experience at all. Just get your skills to a level where it can be of value to other people.

7. Listen more than you talk. Act more than you think. Create more than you doubt.

8. Freelancing is a numbers game. The more content you create/ outreach you do/ calls you book, the better outcome you will get.

9. A sustainable freelancing income is better created through client retention than lead generation. Aim to retain as many clients as possible each month.

10. Prioritise your health. You rely 100% on yourself as a freelancer, and this career choice demands that you be your fittest self to succeed in it.

11. Freelancing is meant to be treated as a business, not a quick rich scheme. Give it time, energy and effort for the long term.

12. If you are underbooked, you need to focus on lead gen and sales. If you are overbooked, you need to raise your prices.
 
13. Your focus should not be to hit $100K as soon as possible just because everyone’s doing it. It should be to set and chase goals that are meaningful to you.

14. Interacting with 10s of people every day will affect your mood. Learn to become resistant to it.

"It's my birthday! Sharing 10 of my thoughts/ reflections/ learnings from the last year, in no particular order (You can read all 21 in my newsletter):

1. Contrary to popular opinion, authenticity is not everything. You need to be intentional in life. Without intention, you will drift, become stagnant and keep hanging by the thread of ""But but I need to stay true to myself..."" Be intentional with everything you think or do.

2. Health comes first. Health is one of the few things that money cannot buy. (Yes, money could pay your hospital bills, but even for that to work, your body needs to be strong enough to fight for itself.) Eat right, breathe right, move, sleep well & prioritise your health.

3. You should trust yourself the most in this entire world. You should be the first person you can think of who will never disappoint you. And the only way to do that is to stick to the promises you make to yourself, give it your best, and not let yourself down.

4. ""Vibe"" is a real metric to consider when you meet new people or face new situations. The energy people radiate and how their energy radiates with you - it's not something to be ignored. Your understanding of vibes may not be accurate yet, but it will become more so with time.

5. ""How was your day"" is a good question to ask others. ""What did you do today?"" is a better question to ask yourself. As time goes by, aim to increase the quality of the list of things you did in a day.

6. There is nothing to ""figure out."" You figure something out and you realise it’s not what you wanted to figure out. Or you figure something out & realise it’s all still messy anyway. Just do what you've got to do, and you will learn, mould, and see results over time.

7. Letting go of anything at all, people, situations, mistakes, experiences… is in your control. It is a conscious decision you must make and act towards. Rather than trying to hate these experiences, become indifferent to them. That's where the real mental freedom lies.
 
8. Call your parents, siblings, family, and friends often, even if only for a few minutes. You need them in your life - To help you overcome the bad, and also to be there to celebrate the good with you. They need you in their life too. Be there for each other. 

9. EVERYTHING is your fault. Take responsibility for every single thing in your life. If you mess up, it's your fault. If you don't do it, it's your fault. If you do it but don't get results, it's your fault. The best? If you succeed in it, it's still your fault. 

10. Contrary to what social media makes you believe, there is so much good in the world. There is beauty, happiness, love, purity, honesty, loyalty & trust. There is something worth fighting for. You need to believe in them, only then will you be lucky enough to experience them.

Thank you all so much for your lovely wishes, and for caring about what I write, create, and share every day with you. Thank you ❤️

"""I have a Master's degree in XYZ but I learnt more from these 7 YouTube videos...""

^ I've been seeing a lot of people talk about this lately.

Here's how I see it:

If you find YouTube videos and threads to be of super-duper high value, then a lot of credit goes to your degree too.

It's simple: You were able to grasp and leverage the high level of information in the YouTube videos because of the work you've put in towards your degree.

Your foundations are strong;
You understand the ins and outs of what you've studied
(even if you didn't pay much attention in class),
And you can comprehend vague information in ways that the average person - without a Master's degree in that field - can't.

Your Master's degree holds its own importance in how you are able to make the most of the information you have access to online.

So does that mean you NEED a Master's degree to know something in-depth? No.

Does it mean you NEED a Master's degree to ""make it""? No.

But remember that one video/ thread/ podcast/ book isn't going to cut it either.

YOU need to take up the responsibility of self-learning and immerse yourself in the topic. You need to be accountable for your own intellectual growth; and you need to put in effort consistently, and over the long term.

So, what are you learning right now?

"Dad, I want to become a doctor

“Okay, prepare for the NEET”

2 years later:

Dad, I want to become a writer

“Okay, look for colleges abroad”

3 years later:

Dad, I want to leave uni & build my business

“Okay, leave uni”

Few months later:

Dad, I've no idea what I’m doing

“Okay, keep doing it anyway”

Still blows my mind that these are REAL conversations with my dad.

I don't know where his endless faith and confidence in me comes from, but it drives me crazy.

There is no way I would be here without him and his reassuring, unending - sometimes baseless (?) - belief in me.

Happy Father's Day to my father ❤️

"Creating content online is hard:

You are tone-deaf if you are real

Inconsiderate of that *one* special case if you’re generic

Promoting burnout by encouraging hard work

A scam if you are successful

Self-absorbed if you love yourself

Pretentious if you have an online audience

Fake if you create content on LinkedIn

Selfish if you look out for yourself

Arrogant if you share your progress

Boastful if you share your wins

Above all: You are cancelled for being human.

Does that stop me from creating content though?

No. It doesn't.

It shouldn't stop you either :)

"My driving instructor taught me parking yesterday - parallel, reverse, and angle.

Keep in mind that I am learning to drive in Dubai. The driving exams here are super challenging, and your instructor needs to have full confidence in you before they can send you for even the internal driving test.

Anyway,

Towards the end of the parking class, my instructor said,
""You're doing good. I'm happy. You're a good student.""

I was so happy that she was happy.

I said, ""Well, you're a good teacher""

And at that moment she just looked at me & started smiling.
It felt as though she had never heard that before...

I can't stress this enough:
Learn to appreciate the people who help you win.

Be it online; be it in person,
Be it help with money-making, driving, cooking, swimming...
Be it anything at all,

Be grateful.

And learn to appreciate people who help you win.

"Last week, 4,878 readers in my newsletter learnt my LinkedIn content strategy. Here's a snapshot:

#1. The Plan

I've planned out my target audience, frequency, the theme of posts and the purpose of each theme. I jot down each idea keeping these in mind.

#2. The Tools

I use Airtable for drafting and saving all my content for future reference. In the newsletter, I also shared my Content Calendar Template for you to reuse. I don't use any scheduling tools for LinkedIn.

#3. The Content

I spend 1 hour a month coming up with 30-60 LinkedIn post ideas, and then spend 10-15 minutes everyday writing a post. (The newsletter includes examples of how I repurpose my tweets for LinkedIn.)

#4. The Process

I list the post ideas, and then pick one idea every day to create a post. I publish the post manually on LinkedIn and update the link on Airtable. Finally, I add a CTA in the comment box of the post as well (Link to my ebooks/ newsletter/ coaching call etc.)

This is only an overview of my newsletter. If you want to get the entire newsletter - including my templates and examples - click the link in the comments.

I hope this helps!

"""Engaging 20x a day"" to grow your LinkedIn brand is hard. That's because 99% of posts on our feeds are not engagement-worthy at all.

Here are 5 ways to find engagement-worthy posts on your feed:

1. Click on specific hashtags that are relevant to your interests/ target audience - eg. #linkedinbranding - and engage with posts under those hashtags. This way you'll skip all the spammy posts on your feed and only find topics you want to read.

2. Make a list of the people that publish engagement-worthy content regularly. Save their profile URLs in your phone/ desktop's Notes app. Then click these links every day and engage with the latest post of your favourite creators.

3. Instead of engaging on posts for 30 minutes straight, engage for 5-10 minutes at a time, multiple times throughout the day. This way you get a better mix of content to engage with.

4. Scroll through and find as many valuable posts as you can. Then refresh the page when the good posts are exhausted.

5. Engage only with high-quality content. The better quality posts you engage with, the more the feed will show similar posts. (The customers of my ebook Ca$hing In on LinkedIn have tried this out and seen good results within a week.)

"""Agree?"" is not a CTA. It's an engagement repellant.

Instead of using the ""A"" word,
Invite your audience to:

1. Comment meaningfully on your post

Ask a thoughtful question that would enhance the value/ point of your post. Comments by the first few people will also inspire more readers to share their views and experiences on your post.

2. Message you

There are many ways to do this - The most common is to highlight a pain point of your audience and encourage them to DM you for information/ advice.

3. Check your profile and follow you

Perhaps you've updated your bio. Or you've added new links to your Featured Section. Or you've received new recommendations. Let your audience know and ask them for their feedback by inviting them to check your profile. (Or simply ask them to follow you.)

4. Sign up for your offer

Be it a free newsletter, an ebook, a product, a service, or a consultation call - you can promote something, free or paid, in your post. Make sure you add the links in the comment box and not in the post itself.

Do this, and take your CTA from engagement repellant to leads and money magnet.

""Agree?""

1. Share a personal/ professional win in a long-form story format once every 2 weeks or so. Personal stories help you self-promote in a narrative format, and give an insight that is not readily available online.

2. Comment, connect, communicate. Engage with other people regularly, and add your ideas and perspective to their posts. Get comfortable with starting conversations. This will also inspire new content ideas!

3. Update your profile page every 3-6 months. Most people create their profiles once and do not update anything except their job roles, probably once a year. Rather, you should regularly update your profile - especially your banner, Summary section, Recommendations, and Features tab.

"A LinkedIn Lie believed by 99% of people:

""Editing a LinkedIn post after publishing it reduces your reach.""

This is false.

I have been editing my LinkedIn posts - with this myth unknown to me - for years, and have seen great reach and engagement regardless.

Also, as soon as I learnt of this myth a few months ago, I started editing published posts as an experiment - Yet again, seeing no difference in my reach and engagement.

As proof, I've attached screenshots of my posts - You can see whether the post has been edited or not under my name in each image. [You can see it on this post too!]

So don't worry if you want your post to look different after you've published it - edit your post fearlessly! If the content is good, it WILL perform above-average regardless of the post-publish edits.

"How to apply the AIDA Marketing Model to your LinkedIn Posts:

Attention = Strong Hook

The hook of the post grabs attention and makes your audience want to read the rest of the post and follow you. To develop a strong hook, first, write down multiple options. Then pick one that you like most. 

Interest = Build-Up

In writing, a build-up creates excitement and intrigue before the main punchline comes through. In a LinkedIn post, the first 2 to 3 lines that follow the hook create the build-up. Use this space to add context to your hook. 

Desire = More Build-up

Now that you've held your audience's attention, it's time to give them a ""drumroll"" feeling that makes them want to keep reading and find out the conclusion of the post. Don’t try to introduce a new idea at this point, only expand on what you're written so far.

Action = The ""Big Bang"" + CTA

This is the point where the drumroll in the reader’s head pauses, and they get the “big reveal” they’ve all been waiting for: the takeaway from your post. Ensure that this lives up to the expectations you've created through your build-up — Only then will your audience want to engage with your post.

Will you try this strategy?

"""If I post more than 1x a week, my audience will get annoyed and my profile won't grow""

I have heard this time and time again from prospects on my discovery calls. Here's why this notion is false and limiting:

1. Limited audience reach:

With every post, you will only reach a small % of your audience. And with every post, this audience will largely be different. So, no, a higher frequency of posts won't annoy your audience - because most of them won't see your content regularly in the first place.

2. Limited opportunities:

Posting 1x a week will slow down your growth. When you post only 1x a week (or 4x a month), you have the opportunity that only 4 posts bring for increasing your reach, generating leads, and building an audience.

On the other hand, if you post a minimum of 3x a week, you'll drive in opportunities through 12 posts a month - each seen by a different segment of your audience.

3. Limited brand recall:

Much of your audience is a silent watcher. They may not engage with your posts; they may not even connect with you or follow you - But they'll know you and your work through your consistency. They may see your posts through people in their network who engage with you, or they may regularly check back on your profile to read your posts.

So when you consistently create content in a specific niche, you build brand recall, and, subconsciously, become the go-to expert in that niche for your audience.

^ Try this out for only 30 days, and you'll see the difference.

And if a higher content frequency overwhelms you, let me help you out. DM me ""consult"" to book a paid LinkedIn Strategy Call with me.

"For some, $1000 a month is a high-ticket offer,
For some, $10,000 a month,
And for some, even $100,000 a month is not high-ticket.

Clearly, there is no fixed number that makes your offering ""high ticket.""

💰 So here’s how I define a high-ticket offer: A high-ticket offer is one that, in itself, is worth the sum of all your client’s invoices.

For example, say you have 3 clients:

Client 1 - Pays you $200 a month
Client 2 - Pays you $150 a month
Client 3 - Pays you $150 a month.

This brings your total income to $500 every month.

💰 Now, a high-ticket offer for you would be one that is worth $400-$500 in itself.

So if you close Client 4 for $500 a month, that is your high-ticket offer (and high-ticket client.)

💰 As you grow, the definition and value of your high-ticket offer will keep changing over months and years.

Say you consistently have 4 clients paying you a total of $1000 a month, then your next high-ticket offer will be worth $800-1000 per month.

Hope this helps!

What do you think of this? How do you define high-ticket offers?

"There are very few people who will think of you to have a contribution to their success...

The picture is my chat with one of my former clients, who wished me for my graduation earlier this month and sent me this message after.

It reminded me of when we had started working together. The pandemic had just hit, and he had to move from running a successful offline training center to replicating it online.

At the time, I’d helped him get started with LinkedIn. I set up and optimised his profile and created regular content for him.

Within the first week, we had 3 posts that garnered over 100,000 views and tons of engagement! He was delighted! It was also a great way of receiving validation for his teachings and skillsets.

The best part though is - My client kept up with LinkedIn even after we completed our work together.

Last we spoke, he gets 40+ inbound leads a day on LinkedIn,
and has a revenue of $50,000+ per month!

I am so happy to see all the success his hard work has earned him, and I am grateful he sees my work to be a contribution to his success.

To more client successes! 🥂😇

"~ The Purchase Decision Behind My Graduation Day Heels ~

🚨 Must-read for all freelancers:

This may seem trivial, but purchasing heels for my graduation ceremony was a big decision for me.

👟 You see, I am a sports shoe person. I practically never wear heels & don’t even own a decent pair.

But this time, I was about to fly 6000 km just to attend my graduation ceremony 🇮🇪, and had to wear heels with my elegant new dress.

🔍 So I set out to look for a good, comfortable pair of heels that I could last a couple of hours in & use on the Irish cobblestones fearlessly.

After looking in a dozen stores and trying on three dozen heels, I tried out the ✨ fancy ✨ Charles & Keith as my last resort.

To my surprise, this is where I found the best pair of heels! They were sturdy; had ample space for my toes, and oh the comfort was like stepping into a fluffy cloud. ☁️

🏷 Price tag: 350 AED.

🧠 Now this is where the purchase decision popped up in my head:

“Hmm, 350 AED…”

“That's... 7000 INR”

“ SEVEN THOUSAND INR???”

“NO WAY I’M SPENDING THAT ON HEELS!”

⏳ I kept the heels on hold & spent the evening trying to arrive at a decision.

Then one fine moment it struck me:

“Okay hold on…”

“7000 INR…”

“That's... $100”

“$100...? Wait, these heels are a steal!”

💡 To my surprise, each currency gave me a different perspective on the value... interesting much?

🧠 Now THIS is where it gets more interesting:

""Okay so… $100? That's like 2 ebook sales.”

“Can I do that today to make my money back?”

“Yes. I will.""

👠 During my overnight decision-making, my mindset went from:

- Cutting back on other expenses after an unplanned purchase
to
- Planning to earn more & make it back.

And this, I think, is one of the unusual mindsets that has always pushed me to work harder & do better.

I think it’s a mindset worth growing into ✨

What do you think? 😊

"The “math” of hitting 6-figures USD per year:

➡️ Work with 8-10 clients for $1000 each per month

➡️ Work with 6-7 clients for $1500 each per month

➡️ Work with 4-5 clients for $2000 each per month

➡️ Work with 3-4 clients for $2500 each per month.

(In addition, ad-hoc clients can make up for +$5k-$15k annually)

🚨 Yes, the “math” is too simple. But there’s a larger perspective we can learn from this:

1. The higher the value of your offer, the more your revenue per client and the fewer clients you need to work with.

2. The intensity and need for lead generation will depend on your offer. With a high-ticket offer, you need only 4-5 clients per month to hit six figures.

3. “Market saturation” is irrelevant to you as a freelancer. You don’t need 1000 clients to run a six-figure business.

4. Excellent service means the same clients will likely renew on a monthly/ quarterly basis.

🤝 With this perspective:

1. Create your high-ticket offer

2. Reach out to prospects daily and aim to close your first 3 clients ASAP

3. Focus on the execution of your services to increase client retention.

😇 It’s not going to be easy, but it is possible!

"“What questions should I ask my client/ what info should I get from them before I start writing their article?”

There’s not much to explain here; simply refer to this checklist next time:

✍🏻 Topic of the article

✍🏻 Purpose/ CTA of the article

✍🏻 Preferred word count

✍🏻 Deadline for the article

✍🏻 Target audience (age group, knowledge level, location etc)

✍🏻 Links to 2-3 references/ preferred sources (+ what is missing in these references that the client would like to have in their article)

✍🏻 Preferred writing style (journalistic, narrative, informal, opinion, etc)

✍🏻 American English or British English

✍🏻 Keyword(s) / related requirements

✍🏻 Any special requests - Meta descriptions; links to images; article banner design, etc

Refine these questions further and make them short and easy to answer. Send these questions across as a Google Doc or Google Form (or ask them over a call), and request your client to fill it in.

Remember: Don’t turn this into a tedious task for your clients. They’ve hired you to make their work easy!

Hope this helps!

"❗️ Contrary to popular opinion, freelancing is NOT a “work for 3 hours a day and make $10K a month” kind of career.

Here are some not-so-well-known “baggage” (or, less dramatically, challenges) of freelancing:

⏰ Work Hours

You are likely to start with working 8-12+ hours a day; 7 days a week; at odd hours; and by yourself.

Like most things though, this too gets easier with time. And you will be able to free up more time for various other interests

💥 Uncertainty/ Instability

Your first year, or even a couple of years, will come with lots of uncertainty and instability.

You will have good months and bad months and some best months - and this will make your income stable on an annual basis. But month by month uncertainty will be present initially.

🥊 Constant Hustle

As you grow, your services and client work itself will become a small part of it all.

Soon you would want to expand and explore more opportunities,
Turn into an agency,
Create more content,
Increase production quality and consistency etc.

⌛️ Mental Overload

And all of that Constant Hustle can easily to lead to a mental overload. It might become difficult to separate your work and work-oriented goals from simple day-to-day activities, and you may end up thinking about work and clients and growth 24x7.

I’ve been there, and it’s a REAL struggle looking past this.

🧠 Mindset Shifts

Made your first $? You need a big mindset shift to make your first $500, and then again for $1000.

Closed your first client? You need a big mindset shift to close your next 5, and then again for 10.

Hired your first teammate? You need a big mindset shift to hire your next 5, then again for your next 10.

The mindset shifts and growth are a continuous process and you need to keep pushing for it beyond your comfort zone.

"4 reasons why you should pick a niche for content creation ASAP:

1. Helps you skip the trial and error + avoids the need to restart from level 0 every few weeks

2. Allows you to build a focused personal brand

3. Improves reach and engagement rate

4. Improves monetisation opportunities.

"~ On focus: The kind no one talks about ~

I follow a lot of fitness accounts on Instagram:

@aja_cortes talks about muscle + strength building - especially through his programs that target specific muscle groups.

@syattfitness talks about heart rate training zones and heart health… and also about counting calories weekly not daily. Recently he also said that his wife tracks only protein + fibre, not calories.

@kneesovertoesguy talks about knee health and the unusual exercises in his ATG routine

@coachmarkcarroll talks about the common mistakes and the tiniest things to focus on in each workout

@bretcontreras1 talks about efficient glute exercises - often different from others who show the same workout.

Everyone is correct yet different in their approach to fitness.

🧠 Subconsciously, I thought each of these things should become my goal now:

“I need to learn what’s Zone 2 and track my heart rate”

“I was already struggling with protein and calories, I need to track fibre too now??”

“If I want good knees I need to add this program?”

My brain started setting up too many related yet unrelated goals.

Then I decided:

🚫 NOPE.

I’m going to follow ONE program and ONLY one program.

I’ll continue to learn about the mechanics and science of workouts and nutrition from all these coaches…

But when it comes to whose advice to follow NOW, I am picking ONE person and following them to the T - for workout plans, cardio options, diet recommendations, tracking methods - everything.

Now I am much more aligned with what I am doing + where I see myself headed.

🤔 Why am I sharing this with you?

Because the same applies to freelancing advice/ freelancing coaches too.

Taking advice from too many people will confuse, overwhelm and mentally tire you.

If you like someone’s strategies/ advice, follow only their advice for 6-12 months. Do everything they say, exactly as they say it.

Because it’s not just ONE thing they say that will make a difference for you… rather it is the SUM of EVERYTHING they advise that works in harmony to bring you the best results.

🤝 Pick ONE person and follow them to the T.

"Start at 15, gain 10 years of experience, and you're still only 25. Starting young is the best advantage you can create for yourself.

^ I published this tweet last week, and it soon became one of my best-performing tweets, with tons of people agreeing and sharing their stories about starting young.

At the same time though, I was surprised by two things:

🚨 1. I was surprised by how many people think that starting young = creating pressure.

In reality,

Starting young = Encouraging trial and error

Starting young = Taking risks with not much to lose

Starting young = Quickly figuring out what does not work for you

Starting young = Having an unfair advantage and priority in a crowd

Starting young = Taking off the pressure of future outcomes by building an unmatched foundation.

🚨 2. I was also surprised by how many people thought starting young meant launching a startup at 15.

No, starting young does not mean launching a startup or building a business or taking up an internship at 15.

Rather, it means:

> Actively pursuing your interests
> Discovering + doubling down on hobbies
> Taking part in events
> Playing a sport
> Selling something
> Travelling and exploring the world
> Meeting new people
> Doing things out of your comfort zone…

🏆 Starting young means doing something the ""average person"" does not.

Starting young means taking up more things with INTENTION, than just for a whim of it.

You do more of what aligns with you,
What brings you joy,
What you can see yourself doing more of in the near and far future.

No, you won't have all the answers right away, but you will learn how to look for them.

🏆 Starting young is the best advantage you can create for yourself. Don’t listen to anyone who says otherwise.

When did you “start”?

#ShreyaWrites

P.S. You don’t need to be 15; the youngest you will ever be is now. Start now.

"My first internship paid me $45 a month.

Second internship, $70 a month.

Third internship, $130.

Fourth, $200.

Getting paid - irrespective of the amount - gave me confidence that my work had value.

It gave me confidence that I could not only get paid for my work,

But I could get paid more and more based on my experience and skillset.

I think this is the reason why I could confidently charge $75 for a 400-word article as my first freelance work (when the “usual” rates were $2-$5), and why I could adopt a charge in advance policy.

And this overall growth mindset is the biggest reason why I’ve taken paid internships only.

It was important that I get paid something - anything - But that I get paid for what I do and know that I need to charge for the work I do.

What’s your biggest takeaway from your internship?

"Freelancing is not an innate ability or a natural talent; it’s a skill acquired through practice.

To understand how, let’s step back and look at what freelancing involves:

A core skill that you can sell as a service
- Can be learnt through practice ✅

Lead generation processes
- Can be learnt through practice ✅

Sales, persuasion and negotiation
- Can be learnt through practice ✅

Written & spoken communication
- Can be learnt through practice ✅

Confidence and boldness to work as per your terms
- Can be learnt through practice ✅

Self-promotion & marketing
- Can be learnt through practice ✅

Building a successful freelancing career is a SUM of ACTIVELY practicing all of these things day in and day out, over months and months and months.

You don’t need to practice each of these skills one by one; you need to practice all of them as the whole sum.

That is, you need to freelance.

Find 1 prospect, get on a sales call, work with them — that’s a full natural practice loop for you.

Keep a check on yourself and look out for what you need to improve upon along the way — there will be something new every couple of weeks or so.

Soon you’ll realise you are GETTING PAID to practice and learn all these new things along the way!

So if you want to be a successful freelancer, commit to practicing it in the long-term.

Do you actively practice freelancing?

"""Market standard"" does not exist in content writing.

When your prospect says their budget is ""as per market standard"", follow up and ask for a specific number or range.

If they are unsure, help them out by sharing your base fee.

"I was telling my dad last week how different life is now in early 20s than it might have been for him, ""Income is low; expenses are higher than ever, and even fundamentals like houses & cars are unaffordable. You can’t really ‘settle’ young these days. There's just too much stress now.""

My dad said, “Stress existed back then too, but at the time you just shut up & dealt with it.”

And that got me thinking:

If I didn't see the words ‘stress’ or ‘pressure’ in others' posts/ captions/ memes 10x a day, would I be using them to describe my daily life?

Would I be so aware of the ‘stress’ - a natural force required to grow - that everything is exerting on me?

I wouldn't.

But now because I am bombarded with the concept of stress & am hyper-aware of the stresses (which, again, are natural & necessary), ‘stress’ is my go-to word to describe everything, all day.

“Freelancing is stressful…”

“Creating content is stressful…”

“This work is causing me so much stress…”

In that way, all aspects of freelancing are ‘stressful.’

But… What isn’t?

Just because everything adds its own stress doesn’t mean we go about acknowledging it every single time, or go about looking for ways to get rid of the stress — quitting being one of the most common ways.

This thought process leads to more stress about seeking & waiting for an idealistic ‘normal, 100% happy, all-good-things life’ that does not exist.

I've thought a lot about this lately and I've come to this conclusion:

Skip the ""I'm stressed"", ""This is so stressful"" self/ public talk. Consciously pull yourself away from it.

Tell yourself ""Shut up and deal with it"" more often.

And once you've dealt with that stress, a new one will be waiting for you... Repeat.

"""Can I freelance along with studying/ a job?""

Yes, you can.

You'll have to stay up late for work;

Work full-time on weekends;

Create content during your breaks;

Skip outings and parties;

Give up on a lot of your ""me time"";

Take on some more mental stress and pressure...

So yes, freelancing + studying/ doing a job is possible.

It doesn't mean it's easy though.

BUT,

As long as you realise that possible ≠ easy,

And as long as you are willing to work through that couple years of grinding,

You'll be able to do both successfully.

Just make sure you prepare your mind for this first!

Your mindset is key to success-oriented action.

⚠️ An occupational hazard of being a content creator: You search for content in everything.

Things become more about “writing about this later” than about being present in the moment.

Plus the touch of personal writing is lost, as the brain is trained to follow “content norms.”

"My goals for 2022 revolve around writing, money, health, and pursuing my personal interests. Here are 7 apps I’ll be using to keep up with my goals:

1. Bear Notes/ Notes app, for writing ideas, occasional personal journals, and these threads. I create folders for each type of writing so that my 1000s of notes are well-organised and easily searchable.

2. Tasks, for creating my digital to-do list. I use this on my MacBook, and have set the app to open as soon as I turn my laptop on. I can easily drag tasks from “In progress” to “Done” etc, which I find visually helpful.

3. StoryGraph/ Booksy, for tracking my reading list. I haven’t used either of these before; looking forward to see how they help me keep up with my reading goals and understand my reading interests.

4. Lifesum, for tracking my calories. I’ll use this regularly for a few months, and probably drop it along the way once I get a hang of what my required daily calorie intake looks like.

5. Strong, for tracking my workout routine and progress. I maintained a diary for my workouts last year, but tracking this digitally will be much more convenient.

6. XMind, for creating mind maps of my content/ ebook/ course ideas. The free version includes tons of visual mind map options. And the one-click list-view is my favourite part.

7. Forest, for making my phone “unusable” for a fixed number of hours. I used this all of 2021, and it is one of my favourite apps ever. Will stick to it in 2022 as well.

How do you track your goals?

"Want to become a better writer?
Write everyday.

Write blogs, social media posts, journals, rants, musings, poems, speeches... anything you like.

Just get in the practice of writing everyday.

One fine day, you'll realise your writing has improved 100x ""effortlessly"".

That’s the power of practice.

P.S. Practice isn't the thing you do once you're good. It's the thing you do that makes you good.

"One of the things I’m most proud of doing this year: Flying Business Class for the first time. I bought my own tickets with my freelancing income… and I never imagined this would happen (at least not so soon).

This was back in May, when I finished college in Dublin and planned to come back home.

My dad literally said, “Come home only if you’re flying Business Class.”

He wanted me to experience that luxury; to see what it means to travel the “rich” way.

And the experience was FANTASTIC.

• A huge Mercedes van with a super-dressed-up chauffeur came to pick me up

• I had priority access through all the queues across the airport

• I was nauseous throughout the flight, and the airhostesses kept checking in on me every hour or so, asking if I needed anything. They even offered me a meal beyond the usual meal-serving times, once I was feeling better

• And of course, the flight itself was relaxing, spacious and super comfortable.

Before I ever flew Business Class, I wondered why people paid so much to basically be able to lie down in a flight for a few hours.

Turns out, the seat itself is a small part of it all — the true essence of this is how everyone treats you as their top priority and moves things around to keep you comfortable and happy.

You really need a taste of this luxury to know exactly how luxurious luxury is.

This one experience 110% pushed me to earn more so I could do this again, and for my family too.

Grateful for everything that made such a life possible for me ❤️

#ShreyaWrites

Happy 2022 everyone! May this be our best year yet 🥂

"What’s one thing you wish you could go back and do differently in 2021?

Write more?
Read more?
Workout more?
Travel more?
Eat healthier?
Sleep better?
Pursue your passions?
Start your business sooner?
Make time for your hobbies?
Spend time with your family?
Play outdoors with your children?

Think about it.

Chances are, what you wish you’d done differently in 2021 can STILL be done in 2022.

You don’t need to go back and “fix” things. Instead, look ahead and aim to do things differently now!

"21 lessons I learnt in 2021:

[Derived from some of my most thoughtful/ heartfelt/ vulnerable/ mindful writings from different times throughout the year]

1. Things will take their own time, and you’ve got to let them. While you “wait” for things to work out, don’t put your life on a halt. Create; learn; practise; rest; get stronger… Make the most of the waiting period.

2. You can improve 100x within a minute if you set your mind towards something. You can hit every note in your vocals class; you can lift your heaviest barbell; you can play your best game. Be in charge of your mind & you’ll almost conquer the action (if not the result)

3. Don’t just try to avoid losses in life; focus more on winning new things. Trying to avoid losses will make you desperate for the win. That desperation will lead to desperate actions, which will often lead you to lose that thing anyway.

4. A lot of things are not in your control. It is what it is. Let it be.

5. More things are in your control than you think. It is what you make it. Work on it and make it happen for you.

6. Your intuition is always right. If something feels “off”, it highly likely is. Pause, reflect and then act — you might just have the power to make it right.

7. Family comes first. They are your ride-and-die. They are your biggest cheerleaders. Always stick close to them.

8. When you find the momentum to do something, don’t let it go. Leverage it, build it, capitalise on it. Momentum is often short-lived, make the most of it.

9. Move. Eat right. Lift heavy. Then lift heavier. Your skin, hair, nails, heart, mind and soul will thank you for it.

10. Stop being over-excited about your achievements. You deserve those achievements for your hard work — you should see them coming. Be level-headed.

11. Create something every day. Creating is the most personally rewarding and freeing thing to do.

12. Learn something because you love it. Look for reasons other than monetisation to spend hours on something.

13. Spend time with yourself; spend some money on yourself. Buy a course, a fancy dinner, a new dress, a new membership… Celebrate yourself.

14. Something affecting you personally does not imply you’re weak or need “fixing.” Sometimes it only means that the situations and circumstances are crappy… and you’re human.

15. At times you will be the smartest, most successful person you know. At other times, you will be the most stupid and naive person you know. Embrace both sides of yourself, and keep turning the stupid-naive times into more of the smart-successful times.

"My early freelancing days were rough:

> Didn't know what boundaries are, and brokedown over rude client texts at 2 AM

> Agreed to per-word pay, and ended up working 10+ hrs for a total of $30

> Didn't set project deadlines, and worked for 2-3 months on a 1-month pay

> Didn't charge in advance, and had to follow up for months to get paid.

Looking back, I'm glad I made these mistakes. They cost me less then than they would've now, and have taught me how to overcome the bigger mistakes I make today.

"“How can I be consistent with freelancing?”

One of the main fears new freelancers have about freelancing is that they won’t be consistent with it.

After all, freelancing is self-employment.

❌ You don’t have a “Manager” or a “Boss” to overlook your work,

❌ You don’t have fixed work hours that you need to login for everyday,

❌ You don’t get a salary cut if you work for 3 hours on one day instead of 5.

So the big question comes up:
“How can I be consistent with freelancing?”

Well, if you aren’t consistent as a freelancer, stress and anxiety will creep up very easily…

✅ Yes, you don’t have a boss, but you do have multiple clients that you are accountable towards.

✅ Yes, you don’t get a salary cut, but you won’t get new clients either if you don’t prospect consistently.

✅ Yes, you don’t have to log in to a system everyday, but you won’t build a sustainable freelancing career if you don’t show up every day.

So if all the positive sides of freelancing aren’t “motivation” enough to be consistent with your work, then use these challenging aspects to keep you consistent.

As I like to say - Do a little bit everyday and enjoy what you do, or cry while doing all of it together.

Either way, it’s you who has to do it… so the former is better :)

"What if Virat Kohli did only cardio in the gym, and had no in-field cricket training? Would he be one of the best cricket players we've seen?

No, of course not.

Virat Kohli NEEDS in-field training.

That's how I feel about internships & freelancing too: Internships will not teach you how to freelance.

Yes, internships *might* help you learn the work itself, eg, social media management or article writing etc.

But those things make up only 5-10% of a successful freelancing career.

Freelancing relies heavily (90-95%) on things that are not part of an internship:

• Lead generation (most important!)
• Personal branding
• Creating services & setting prices
• Persuasion & proposals
• Conducting sales calls
• Closing clients
• Dealing with payments
• Setting terms & conditions
• Managing client concerns and issues
• Working with new people regularly.

You can't expect internships to teach you all these aspects of freelancing.

Freelancing is freelancing, and it requires hands-on experience in well... freelancing!

Now, you can still choose to take up an internship to learn how to do a particular task.

However, consider whether you want to take up the 40+ hours a week of stress and extra time-involvement (eg. travel) that comes with an internship,

Or instead use that time to learn freelancing as soon as possible.

Bottom line:

If you want to be a freelancer, start freelancing.

"19,000+ words; 128 pages; 3 free bonuses… Creating Ca$hing In on LinkedIn has been a wonderful adventure! And a rather personal one too…

After all, where I am now and what I have built now… it all goes back to, and starts from, LinkedIn.

LinkedIn was the first platform where I published my work non-anonymously; the first platform where I was known as a writer; the first platform where I found my clients.

In the last 3 years, LinkedIn led me to achieving incredible, life-changing things that I am immensely grateful for:

🔹 Making 6-figures USD from my dorm room as a full-time undergraduate student

🔹 Graduating early from university & starting my own agency (still don't have my degree certificate by the way, and have never needed one to run my business)

🔹Building an audience of 200,000+ across various platforms

🔹 Writing 4 ebooks and selling 1000s of copies of my ebooks to readers worldwide

🔹 Helping 1000s of freelancers beat the low industry “rates & expectations”…

Naturally, with every chapter I drafted,
Every strategy I shared, and
Every post screenshot I added to the ebook,
I looked back upon the 3 years I’ve spent creating content and building an audience on LinkedIn.

It’s been a long journey, but I couldn’t be more grateful for where it has led me.

I’m so excited that an ebook so informative and yet so personal is NOW OUT for you to read!!! 🤩

And yes, the long, amazing reviews you all are sending in… they make all of this so much more worth it.

Thank you all for being a part of my journey, and I hope you enjoy Ca$hing In on LinkedIn! ❤️

"You want popcorn 🍿

You go to the shop and ask, “What’s the price per popcorn? I want 80 pieces”

Now does the popcorn guy give you a price per popcorn?

No, he says “$5 for a tub 🍿”

Insist all you want. Go ahead and say,

>> “I only pay by the popcorn”

>> “$5 for 100 popcorn pieces… so $0.05 per popcorn…?”

>> “If you don’t give a per-popcorn rate, I’ll buy it from someone else”

Doesn’t matter.
The popcorn guy will stand by “$5 for a tub 🍿”

Now do you understand how to deal with prospects who insist on a price per word?

#ShreyaWrites

Psst… this works the other way round too:

The customer asks you for a tub of popcorn 🍿

You say, “Okay, so that’s $0.05 a piece… how many pieces do you want?”

The customer’s gonna give you this look 🧐😟😡 and walk out.

Lesson? Stop pricing your popcorn by the piece!

"Top 7 takeaways from my Twitter Spaces co-hosted with @lifemathmoney:

#ONE. The difference between LinkedIn & Twitter?

Twitter can be more overwhelming than LinkedIn. You can get by on LinkedIn with 1 post every alternate day; but Twitter demands 3-5 tweets per day + tons of engagement.

LinkedIn also won't let you be anonymous :)

#TWO. Once you’re successful, most people will say you just got lucky.

They won’t realise that luck is self-generated: You create luck for yourself through your own actions and hard work.

#THREE. Have Writers’ Block?

@lifemathmoney goes for a walk - without a phone or headphones. Once he’s back, he’s able to start writing easily.

@shreyapattar (me) just stares at a blank document for 10-30 mins. It allows my brain to reorganise my thoughts, and then start writing.

#FOUR. Tons of people make tons of money online only by... selling courses on how to make money online!

They sell well probably 'coz most of these courses are plagiarised - just because they are cheap/ by non-experts doesn’t mean they don’t have value.

#FIVE. You are one DM away from finding your first client and making money online.

#SIX. Freelancing is 10% dependent on your core skill, and 90% about prospecting, sales, negotiation, people skills, etc.

If you want to start freelancing, don't try to ""perfect"" your skill; focus on finding your first client ASAP.

#SEVEN. The content creation space is crowded now thanks to the pandemic. Once people get back to their busy, “normal lives”, this number will go down drastically.

If you want to stand out, create quality content and stick to it long-term.

"I freelanced while studying full-time for 3 years. Then I graduated early because I was able to scale my biz pretty well… while attending lectures, events & more.

Here are 8 simple tips for managing freelance work as a student, based on personal experience:

#ONE Realise freelancing while studying full-time is going to be challenging.

You’ll have to sacrifice some sleep, outings & gatherings. Mentally prepare yourself for that challenge.

#TWO Pay full attention to college lectures; don’t try to sneak work in at that time.

Maximise your lecture time for learning, rather than struggling in the last-minute.

#THREE Complete your college assignments asap.

I’m more of a research-and-create-an-outline-immediately-but-wait-until-the-last -5-hours-to-write-the-essay kind of person… but that’s overwhelming. Just finish your assignments asap so you are mentally free & focused.

#FOUR Use the time between lectures.

If you have long breaks, use it for sales calls or doing client work. If you have short breaks, respond to DMs and emails, and set up calls. Also write a post or two for your social media.

#FIVE Make the most of your weekends.

I spent about 15 hrs every weekend working for my clients, compared to 2-3 hours per day during the week.

#SIX Increase your rates & decrease the number of clients.

You’ll keep making the same monthly revenue (or more), while also working with fewer clients. Experiment with this for every new sales calls you get on.

#SEVEN Start outsourcing.

Hire one person. Give them some work, see how they do, see how you feel about it. Then hire one more. Then one more. Remember: Anyone you hire should reduce your time involvement, not increase it or complicate it.

#EIGHT Plan & prepare in advance.

Inform clients asap if you need more time for a task. Don’t take on new clients during exam week. Continue taking sales calls even when you’re fully booked. Book clients a few weeks or months in advance, perhaps with a refundable deposit.

Comment any questions you have about freelancing as a student!

"I HATED walking my puppy. He always pulled me along on his leash and NEVER walked straight… until today.

Here’s what happened [& 3 life-changing lessons you can learn from this]:

I have a Doberman puppy, Harvey (aka best boi.) He’s 7 months old; weighs over 80lbs.

In the 3 months that I have been home, I have only “walked” him ONCE. Now only my dad does.￼

Why? Because Harvey is a huge puppy… and the distractions in India are too many to have a peaceful walk without looking around all the time. So now he easily pulls us along with him on the leash.

This turned the walks into a mentally & physically stressful workout.

Yes, we had a dog trainer, but their leash-walking methods were not working well.

So today we had a new dog trainer come over — Someone who specialises in training big dogs, and someone who has trained multiple Dobermans before.

This changed everything…

As soon as this new dog trainer came in, he showed us a ‘slip lead with a nose loop.’ (Example in picture 2)

The main function of this slip lead and nose loop is to control the HEAD of the dog.

The leash itself is very comfortable for the dog and does not bother them, but a slight tug on the leash will instantly turn the dog’s head in your direction.

So every time Harvey was distracted by something,
The trainer tugged the leash,
Harvey’s head turned towards the trainer,
He lost eye contact with that distraction,
And he continued to walk straight ahead.

(Of course the good boi got many treats during the training!)

And that’s how the leash-pulling problem was solved in just one minute: By using a slip lead to regularly turn Harvey’s head away from the distractions.

Because, as the dog trainer said, “You control the head, you control the dog.”

This 15-minute experience taught me 3 MAJOR lessons:

#ONE. When hiring anyone, hire experts for your specific need.

Our previous trainer had trained many dogs before, but never a Doberman. This ineffective training in puppyhood led to bigger problems over the months… which could have been avoided by hiring a Doberman expert.

#TWO. Don’t overlook issues when they are small.

Harvey has been pulling on his leash for quite some time now. We thought it was puppy excitement and will fade over time — not true. Had we focused on this problem sooner, it wouldn’t have gotten to such a stressful point.

#THREE. Your head controls your body.

The world is full of distractions. Your head will always have something to look at & focus on, BUT not everything is worth that focus.

YOU must be your own slip lead & pull your head away from distractions.

Control your head; control your body.

"My 3rd ebook Freelancing Freedom sold 150 copies in 6 hours.

90% people didn’t even read my sales page (I know because they DM’d me asking for the difference between the editions!)

I was really surprised at first, but soon realised the lesson there:

Most of your audience buys the product simply because the product is from YOU.

They may not ‘need’ the product, but they purchase it because they trust YOU and value YOUR advice.

THAT’S the power of building an audience… Are you building one yet?

"💰 When you use per-word pricing:
“That will be $1.5 per word for web copy worth 1000 words”

>>> 😱 “$1.5 for just one word???”

>>> 😱 “ Wait, let me calculate that… $1500 for web copy???”

>>> 😱 “So I’ll pay you as per the word count post the completion of the project, right?”

versus

💰 When you use per-project pricing:
“That will be $1500 for the web copy”

>>> 😄 “Got it. What are the next steps?”

While you may be doing well with per-word pricing, you don’t realise how MUCH better you could do with per-project pricing.

Per-project pricing will truly make your freelancing career easier, and your life more stress-free.

Here’s why:

With per-project pricing…

1️⃣ You are giving a value for the client’s requirement, not the number of words you write.

2️⃣ You are removing the element of surprise — if the web copy ends up at 2000 words, your client may not agree to pay you $750 more.

3️⃣ You are removing the element of calculation. It’s a simple, straightforward amount, and small numbers do not multiply into big numbers.

4️⃣ You come across as a professional who knows how to value their service and convey the value clearly.

5️⃣ You can charge 100% in advance.

Over the years, I have had multiple teachers in school and college who have given me the opportunity to speak for a large audience; read out loud to a large audience; write for the class bulletin boards and school magazines; and learn how to become a leader.

Be it my class teachers critiquing my poems and giving me advice for my occasional stage nervousness; or be it my mentors in the Business School in college who introduced me to people and opportunities that changed my life… All these small moments turned me into a confident public speaker, a writer, and now, a businesswoman.

And even today, I continue to have wonderful business mentors, who selflessly give me their time and guidance, even though I have never met them in person. I would be a hundred steps behind where I am right now, if it weren’t for their constant guidance.

I am truly grateful to have had some wonderful teachers over my many years of school and college, and now my business times.

They have scolded me, supported me and helped me become who I am today. This short video is just a small tribute to my teachers, in my own way.

Happy Teachers’ Day 👩🏻‍🏫❤️

#ShreyaWrites

And thanks to so many of you who wished me today. I’m honoured that you see me as a teacher in your life. Thank you 🙏🏻❤️

"For the past few months, things have been seeming “gamified.”

How many clients can I close this month?

How many ebooks can I sell?

How much revenue can I generate?

This weird gamification mindset is not as much about the $$$ as it is about getting to the “next level.”

It’s making me work on what aligns with my goals.

It’s keeping me on my mental toes, constantly.

Is that a good or bad thing? I’m not sure.

All I know is that it’s working for now.

"An Indian prospect recently told me, “You should charge less now that you are back in India.”

No. I will NOT charge less.

I will NOT charge for my bare survival.

I will charge for my value, and to give my family the best of everything.

To buy my parents the dream car they gave up on to let me get the best of education.

To help my sister too get the best of education.

To take my family on luxurious long trips that they enjoy so much.

To give my parents the option to retire as early as they like.

I charge what I charge to improve the lives of the people I love, and myself.

I’m building my legacy on my own terms. Literally.

"When should freelancers ask for a raise?

After 3 months of work?
6 months?
1 year?

Time isn’t the main consideration here.

It’s this:

When you’re okay with losing the client.

Why? Two reasons:

1. Unless you have a really excellent relationship with your client and are supremely confident of them agreeing to your new rates, the client may be reluctant to increase your rates. They’ll either decide to drop you, or ask you to stick to your old rates.

2. If you decide to stick to your old rates, mainly in the fear of losing the client, then the client will (very likely) take you for granted and squeeze more work out of you.

So, a good time to raise your prices with your existing clients is when you’re okay with losing them.

Have you ever asked a client for a raise?

"99% of my articles require 0 edits. Here’s how:

1. I ask my clients for links to 2-3 articles that they really like (their own, or that of others). This helps me understand exactly what they are looking for in terms of voice, tone, writing style, etc.

2. I get the outline of the article approved by the client prior to writing the article. This ensures that the client and I are on the same page with the final cut of the article.

3. I cite all sources and mention all references in the end of the article. This avoids any further questions of “Hey where did this info come from?”

Try this out — it will make your writing intentful and stress-free; and your life easy with your clients.

"How can freelancers handle multiple clients?

Usually the response would be:
Either ‘make time for the work’,
or ‘decline new projects if you cannot make time for them.’

Here’s something more from my freelancing experience:

#ONE. Realise that you don’t need to work for every single client every single day.

For example, I give 2-3 hours a week to each of my client (say, 5-7 hours a week if I didn’t have a team.) Instead of doing this as 1-2 hours of work every single day, I have fixed days for each client — say, client 1 on Tuesdays.

Not only does this help me get the work done fast, but it also helps my brain work more creatively by focusing on the same client at a stretch.

This is especially useful for projects that go on for a few weeks or months, unlike a one-off article.

#TWO. Don’t take up one-off work, unless it is incredibly high-paying.

If you don’t have a choice and NEED to accept such work, by all means, go ahead and do it.

But be aware that the more smaller projects you undertake, the more work you have to do. ALSO! The more smaller projects you take up, the more clients you have to deal with. So you’re not “spending 2 hours writing an article”, but spending much more time adjusting to a new client, raising a new invoice, waiting for a new payment, making new kinds of edits, etc.

Which means...

#THREE. Prioritise monthly projects.

“But Shreya, no one hires me for a full month...”

That’s not the main problem.

The main problem is you not having an offer worth a recurring monthly retainer.

You then miss out on converting a one-off prospect into a monthly retainer client.

So set up a monthly, preferably high-ticket offer first. Then LIST people who can benefit from the offer, and REACH OUT to them on various platforms or via email. Don’t keep waiting for them to approach you.

Of course there’s a lot lot more to this, which I’ll cover some other time.

Comment any questions about handling multiple clients.

Being in the buyers’ market is not wrong, but staying in the buyers’ market will keep you struggling with your price & payment terms.

When you commoditise your services,
You are one among many.

When you exceptionalise your services,
You are the ONLY one amongst many.

Are your services commoditised or exceptionalised?

P.S. Be the exceptional being who separates themselves from the herd and the fate of the herd.

"‘Freelancer’ and ‘entrepreneur’ are terms that are used interchangeably these days.

"The REAL Reason Why Startups Fail

Getting some funding could help freelancers too get a comfortable start. Yet freelancers do not look for funding actively.

Why?
Because freelancers know that once they find clients, all their initial expenses and investments will be recovered through their clients’ payments.

So, instead of looking for funding,
Freelancers look for clients that can pay them and allow them to run a self-sustainable business.

Like freelancing businesses, there are also many startups that don’t need funding,
And can be self-sustainable only if they focus on finding customers and running their startup through customer generated revenues.

Of course, it may take longer to be profitable, but that’s just the nature of running a startup.

Instead, when startups focus on raising large amounts of funding, they put customer acquisition in the backseat.

If the startup doesn’t get funding in a few months, they will have exhausted all their resources by then.

So, I think more startups need to adopt the freelancers’ mindset:

• Look for more clients/customers,
• Focus on increasing their income/revenue to be self-sustainable & retain major chunk of ownership.

What do you think? Why do startup fail?

"Recently, Basecamp’s CEO Jason Fried banned societal & political discussion in their internal chat forums, saying,

“These are difficult enough waters to navigate in life, but significantly more so at work... It saps our energy, and redirects our dialog towards dark places. It’s not healthy, it hasn’t served us well.”

This led to one-third of Basecamp employees opting to quit their jobs.

A few days later, Fried apologised for the policy changes that felt simple, reasonable, and principled, but “blew things up culturally in ways we never anticipated... We have a lot to learn and reflect on, and we will.”

What do you think about such policies?
Would they ever make you quit a company?

"9-Step Checklist For Sharing Your Articles With Your Clients ⬇️

1. Center align the headline. Justify align the body.

2. Use H2 or H3 for the headline. Use ""Normal Text"" for the body.

3. Use Title Case for headline.

4. Provide 1-2 alternatives for the headlines. The topics provided by clients are usually explanatory, and need to be turned into crisp, impactful headlines.

5. Make the subheadings bold so they stand out.

6. Hit ""enter"" after every bullet point. Spacing out points/ paragraphs makes the article visually appealing.

7. Always cross-check the accuracy of the content. Eg, the heading says ""7 key points"", but the article has only 5.

8. If your heading mentions ""7 key points"", the points should be mentioned in number 1-7, not with bullets.

9. Add page break after each article.

How many of these do you follow?

Comment any questions.

"In April 2020, I had 20k followers on LinkedIn.
It took me 1.5 years to hit that 20k.

In April 2021, I now have 90k followers on LinkedIn.
It took me 1 year to gain 70k.

Along with this exponential growth in followers, I also started getting 3-5 inbound leads every single day...

My income grew by at least 15x in the last one year...

Mainly because of consistent content creation on LinkedIn.

This Saturday, in my first webinar with HelloMeets, I am sharing the methods that helped me go from 0 to 90K followers (and zero-income to thousands of dollars) on LinkedIn.

"4 reasons why you should NOT charge an advance as a freelancer:

1. You enjoy taking stress

2. You love chasing your clients for payment for months

3. You like taking avoidable & unnecessary risks

4. You want to come across as “nice” and don’t mind not getting paid.

"“I am no good at this”
“I just can’t do it”
“It’s not meant for me”

I hear & see such words repeatedly in my 1:1 consultation calls & my DMs.

This is self-deprecating talk, which usually starts out as a way to appear modest.

Let’s say you made a painting.

Your friend says, “What a beautiful painting!”

You respond, “Not at all. Look at this line & this colour... it’s all off.”

This ‘modesty’ very easily turns into a defensive belief system.

Now every time you paint, you think “This line & this colour are wrong...”

This leads to:

1. Deep dissatisfaction with any of your paintings
2. Possibly giving up on painting completely.

Soon this self-deprecative talk spreads to all other areas of your life.

Eventually, something that started as ‘modesty’ becomes an excuse that keeps you stagnant.

And it pulls you down. Really low.

The solution?

Celebrate your victories & achievements, however ‘small’ & ‘insignificant’ they appear to you.

And start seeing failure as a failure (an opportunity to improve upon or move on); not something to glorify or wallow in.

Stop using self-deprecative talk.

Value yourself.
Only then will the world value you.

"“Hot chocolate. (Coffee free)”

My mom was at a coffee shop 🧜🏼‍♀️ last week.

She was surprised by this offer on the menu, and ordered a hot chocolate for my sister and a coffee for herself.

The barista gave the order total, which was much more than the cost of the hot chocolate.

My mom asked them about the extra charge, to which they said “One hot chocolate and one coffee.”

“But the menu says the coffee is free,” said my mom.

“No,” said the barista. “The hot chocolate is coffee-free. Means it has no coffee.”

Coffee free

Coffee-free.

"When you apply to a foreign university, they aren’t just looking for a “good student”. They are looking for what YOU can offer them, and how you will amplify their brand/ institutional name.

Your academic marks are just the minimum entry requirement for a foreign university.

And the number of students who meet the minimum marks criteria is huge. This means thousands of applicants have similar grades, thousands have done similarly well in their academics, and thousands have met the minimum requirements in their SATs or IELTS or TOEFL.

So, how does the university decides who should join them?

That’s where everything apart from your grades gets factored in:

Your values
Your work ethic
Your skills
Your passions
Your interests
Your internships
Your achievements
Your motivation to study
Your plans for college
Your goals after completing college
What you intend to do with what has been taught to you...

These things are a part of your SOP, so make sure you invest time in writing, rewriting, and yet again rewriting it.

These decide your acceptance.

Make the university believe in your potential because of your past accomplishments. Good luck!

Passions can be obsessions.

Hobbies can be self-indulging;

"8 years ago, a startup raised a seed fund of US $1.3 million. They never raised any further capital, and are now valued at $4 billion.

This sort of low funding towards a billion-dollar valuation is rather unusual for any startup.

But Zapier, an online automation tool that connects your apps and services, made it happen.

How?

By raising a seed fund, and then chasing customers, not VCs.

This had allowed the founders to own 80% shares! This is incredibly rare for any successful startup.

Most startups, upon raising a seed fund, continue to look for VCs who can fund them further. And keep diluting their equity.

But, by focusing on customer acquisition, instead of growth for growth sake, Zapier generated its own revenue and became profitable.

What adds to their profitability is that team has been working remotely right from the beginning.

Today, Zapier has 350 employees. And all of them continue to work remotely.

So, what's the takeaway?

1. Raise a seed fund and be profitable as soon as possible
2. Chase customers, not VCs
3. Use your resources to add value and gain paying customers.

What's your favourite takeaway?

"Sitting on her bedroom floor, Taylor Swift wrote the superhit song 'Love Story' in 20 minutes.

Inspired by William Shakespeare’s ‘Romeo and Juliet’, this song debuted at #16 on the Billboard Hot 100, selling 97,000+ digital downloads.

The song was released when Taylor Swift was 19 years old, and it put her on the map globally.

All of this was possible because she decided to spend those 20 minutes doing something she loved.

The lesson?

You never know when our small actions can lead to BIG results.

You never know when ONE thing can just 'click' and bring you success.

So, start investing time,
Every single day,
In something you love doing.

What will you work on every single day?

"Given a choice, which would you choose:

1. Strengthen your strengths?
or
2. Improve upon your weaknesses?

These 3 ideas may help you make the decision:

1. Strengthen your strengths. This will make you an expert in the field.

2. If the weakness is character-related, improve upon that weakness.

3. If the weakness is skill-related, then delegate the task.

All individuals and systems have inherent weaknesses.

So it’s okay to have weaknesses... as long as you are aware of them.

Just don’t confuse your weakness as strengths.

Which one would you choose? Comment!

#ShreyaWrites

P.S. Strengthen your strengths to be exceptional.

"Speed of rocket while taking off: 160 kmph

Speed of rocket while in space: 28,000 kmph

Starts appear slow because it takes immense energy and sustained effort to overcome inertia.

But you can overcome inertia by taking action and making things happen:

Network with 1 person.
Come up with 1 idea.
Get 1 investor.
Close 1 client.
Earn 1 dollar.

Strive to overcome your own inertia.

Just fire up and blast off... find your own orbit!

"5 Things My Schooling Taught Me:

1. Be accountable.

— Do the tasks given to you. Never blame others for your mistakes. And don’t justify your failures.

2. Be appreciative.

— Applaud others’ grades, talents, victories. You own what you cheer.

3. Be a good student.

— Be curious and stay in learning mode. Always!

4. Develop your competitive edge.

— Take initiative. Active participation in sports and events sets the foundation for future work ethic.

5. Be ever grateful to teachers and non-academic staff.

— They did the best they could under the circumstances.

What have you learnt from your schooling?

"How To Overcome Writer's Block:

#1. Turn your creativity into a habit

- Set a writing routine: write at fixed hours and in a fixed place everyday.

#2. Note down all your outpouring of ideas on the good days

- Revisit them when you're out of ideas.

#3. Ditch the beginning

- Write the body of the article. Or the conclusion. Get yourself in the zone.

#4. Read other people's content

- Rewrite it with your own ideas. (Don't copy!)

#5. Take a break

- Take a nap. Go for a walk. Cook. Play guitar. Take a shower. Relax.

#6. Don't label it as ""writer's block""

- “Plumbers don’t get plumber’s block, and doctors don’t get doctor’s block; why should writers be the only profession that gives a special name to the difficulty of working, and then expects sympathy for it?"" ~ Philip Pullman

"In September 2018, I asked my dad for his credit card, to pay for an Apple Music subscription.

The cost was $1 (~INR 60) per month.

My dad said,
""Okay, I will pay for 2 months.
From the 3rd month onwards, your writing should pay for it.""

I replied, ""3 months. Then I'll pay.""

At that time,
Earning even $1 per month seemed absolutely impossible.

It felt like such a far-fetched dream,
That I asked for 3 months to actually start earning even $1 per month from my writing.

But that conversation gave me something to work towards: an emotional goal.

And in that month itself, I earned $150 from my writing. For the first time ever!

Lesson?

Sometimes, even the ‘smallest’ of your goals will seem impossible.

But, if you just start working towards them,
Achieving the ‘small’ goal will become easier with time.

Baby steps...

"7 Tips To Enjoy The Holiday Season As A Freelancer:

1. Share your availability with your clients.

2. Ask your clients about their availability.

3. Give your clients deadlines for ""ordering"" new work.
For eg. ""For any new work, please message me by 15th December, so I may complete the work before I take a break.""

4. Spend 1-2 every single day, including holidays, on work.
This will reduce the stress of resuming work from a standstill after the holidays.

5. Focus on prospecting.
You are losing 2 weeks' worth of prospecting this month, so focus on it for the first 2-3 weeks of December.

6. Close deals for January, and get paid in advance to book your time.
This will help you keep up with the momentum of your work and income.

7. Protip: You may offer new clients a 5-10% discount for booking you 1 month in advance.

And finally, enjoy your holidays guilt-free!

Wishing everyone an amazing December... work hard and party hard!

"As a freelancer, you have certain skillsets.

You may have hired freelancers, with skillsets similar to or different from yours.

Now, all of you work together as a team, and help your clients meet their goals.

Suddenly, a client’s work goes wrong.

The client didn’t like an article that your teammate wrote, and reaches out to you with a grievance.

Now, what do you do?

Do you say the piece was not written by you, but by your teammate?
Do you blame your writer?
Do you instantly call and blast your writer?

OR
Do you take responsibility and focus on solving the client’s issue?

When we have a team, each person on our team is individually responsible to submit their best work.

BUT, as a leader,
You are responsible for each person on your team.

So if a client has any concerns,
As a leader,
YOU should be accountable, and
YOU should take the responsibility of fixing the problem instantly.

How do you deal with such situations?

"Protip for writing an email:

End your email with a question.

“What do you think about this?”

“Does this interest you?”

“By when can I expect to hear from you?”

“When would you like to begin?”

When you end your email with a question, you turn a one-way email into a two-way conversation.

Your question gives the email recipient something to think about,

Which then nudges them into responding to you.

So, end your email with a question!

I spoke to a prospect last month.

The conversation was smooth:

• He had done his homework
• He knew exactly WHAT he wanted
• He knew exactly HOW we wanted that to happen
• He had all the information I would need, in one place
• His expectations were optimistic & realistic.

Most importantly,
He had been observing me on social media for months, and he KNEW he wanted ME to help him.

We finalised everything almost instantly.

Just before we wrapped up the call, he said, “I’m going to be an amazing client, because that’s the kind of client I would want to work with...”

Hearing this was EVERYTHING.

"Should you charge your friends & colleagues for your services?

As a content writer, I have received these requests from people I know, multiple times:

• Can you give me good Instagram captions?

• Can you help me edit my college essay?

• Can you rewrite my LinkedIn profile?

• I am applying for a job, could you help me out with the writing assignment?

• My brother wants to learn freelancing, can you give him a free consultation?

• I’m building a personal website, can you write the content?

I love it when the people I know approach me for help with content.

I’m glad they think of me.

But, at the end of the day, content writing is a service I offer and I will charge for it.

The best way to deal with requests from your friends?

1. Clarify that you will be charging them
2. Offer a “Friends & Family discount”
3. Set clear terms & conditions, to avoid being stuck in the “it’s for a friend” loop.

"I hit 10K followers in 5 months on Instagram!

April 2019: Created my Instagram account & rarely posted

May 2020: Made a decision to post regularly

I followed the “book”:

Post daily,
Respond to comments,
Comment on other people’s posts,
Use lots of hashtags…

And started gaining 15-20 followers everyday.

This meant… I would hit the 10k mark in about 2 years.

The “book” was not working for me.

So, I decided to do WHAT I enjoy doing, no matter how CRAZY it seemed!

- Shared ALL my learnings for FREE

- Created relevant, engaging carousels

- Hosted weekly Q&As

- Did multiple LIVE sessions every week (40+ hours of FREE content available on my page)

- Multiple LIVE interviews every week

- Created freelancing memes on Reels…

Within 5 months, BOOOOOOOOM!

Hit the 10k mark!

(And now I finally have the super useful “Swipe Up” feature!)

Lesson? Stop focusing on what worked for others, and focus on doing what you enjoy doing.

Own the process and make things work for you, in your OWN way.

"I released my first ebook #Anthology in August, and in September I wrote an ebook for a client!

Creating #Anthology helped me understand what goes into writing an ebook.

So, when a client approached me to write them an ebook as a lead magnet, I instantly said yes!

I created the structure,
Planned out the details,
And finished writing the ebook within 3 days.

The client accepted the ebook in the first submission!

My client’s ebook would not have been possible without actually having written an ebook for myself first.

This is exactly why we, the content writers, need to focus on creating content for ourselves.

It’s good to create content for clients,
But before that we need to create similar content for ourselves.

Write articles,
Share LinkedIn posts,
Post on Instagram,
Create videos on YouTube…

Start doing things for yourself,
And use that experience to help your clients!

What will you start creating for yourself?

"8 reasons why freelancers should charge an advance:

1. Qualify the client — if they pay an advance, they most probably will be responsible clients.

2. Seal the deal — clients are less likely to ghost you after paying you for the work.

3. Set your payment cycle — getting paid in advance helps you gauge your monthly workload and income.

4. Show your professionalism — charging an advance (and sticking to your terms) is a mark of professionalism & integrity.

5. Fix the client’s investment — when you’re charging a fixed fee upfront, there are no hidden costs for the client to worry about later.

6. Reduce stress & distrust — when you’ve received an advance, you’re more focused on giving a quality output rather than worrying about getting paid.

7. Focus on the work 100% — when you are not stressed about the payment, you can fully focus on the work.

8. Always get paid — set this non-negotiable term, and always get paid!

Do you charge an advance?

2. Resilience

Freelancing is unpredictable, and you must be mentally and emotionally prepared to FACE and RECOVER from anything that comes your way.

Adapt to the sudden changes and deal assertively with difficult situations.

3. Self-promotion

The only way to freelance successfully is to make people aware that you exist.

Self-promote/ market yourself your skills, usefulness, experiences and achievements.

With that being said, check out my ebook #Anthology — link in comments!

Which of these skills are you working on?

"How freelancers can improve their mental health:

1. Choose ‘stress-free’ clients

Strive to find clients who are ‘easy’ to work with. Strive to find clients who value your work and efforts. (Yes, they are such clients out there.)

2. Focus on making money.

Money pays your bills and gives you the freedom to choose your clients, teammates and working hours. Of course, don’t use money to solve problems it cannot solve!

3. Respect yourself and your time.

Fire clients and teammates if needed. Walk away from unpleasant and energy draining people.

How do you prioritise your mental health?

"""How do I know I have enough skills to be paid?""

When you know you can do something for someone, that

- they cannot do themselves
- they don’t want to do themselves
- they don't have time to do themselves
- they don't care about doing themselves...

When you know you can do something for someone, that
- saves them money
- makes them money
- entertains them
- makes them learn & grow
- makes them forget their pain
- saves them discomfort...

When you know you can do something for someone, that
- you enjoy doing
- you are confident about
- you are committed to...

What’s one skill you have that people can pay you for?

"“My 14yo brother made ₹20k in 4 weeks and is able to get clients beyond Fiverr. What should I advise him?”

I was asked this question on my Instagram LIVE yesterday.

My response:
He is 14 years old
He made ₹20k in 4 weeks

Do NOT advise him.

He is on a roll right now, and has the momentum and confidence going for him.

He is learning intuitively and figuring out what is working for him.

He is able to connect with clients in a meaningful way that makes them pay him.

He is able to showcase his usefulness in the real world.

Yes, he may not know words like lead generation, sales funnel, types of pricing etc.

But he has his own superpowers:

• high energy levels
• self-learning by trial & error
• being unhindered by the burden of expectations
• striving only for results
• low cost of failure.

Allow youngsters to own their successes and also their failures; it will keep them grounded too!

What would you advise this 14yo who made ₹20k in 4 weeks?

"Within a week of posting on YouTube, I got my first lead today!

I've wanted to create YouTube videos for a while...

I didn't have any meant-for-YouTube videos, so I kept waiting to make videos suitable for the platform.

Then, last week, I made a decision.

I decided to start posting on YouTube the videos that I had - my IGTV, interviews, webinars, etc.

And today morning, I got a lead who found me on YouTube!

This proves again & again:

Starts are supremely paramount.
Any start is better than the most perfect/ ideal start.

You don't need to the create ""perfect content.""

You don't need to wait for the ""perfect time.""

All you need to do is start. Just start.

Make use of your beginner’s luck!

"Do we need a very large vocabulary ?

Not necessarily.

What’s necessary is mastery over the words we already know!

Know the words we know, intimately.

Know how to weave the words we know, magically.

Know how to use the words we know, authoritatively.

Know how to communicate with the words we know, confidently.

When we have such a bond with the words we already know, our vocabulary will naturally keep improving.

How confident are you of your present vocabulary?

"For months & months, I avoided going to the gym.

Getting out of the bed,
Putting on gym clothes,
Wearing socks & shoes,
Walking to the gym... it was all such a huge task.

I sat around waiting for “motivation”, the “right time”, “right mood”...

For “motivation” & “right mood,”
I watched workout videos,
Read about meal plans,
Downloaded workout apps.

Finally, I decided to just get up and go.

2x a week...
3x a week...
4x a week...

Now, I regularly go the gym 4-5x a week.

Where did I find the motivation to workout?

I did the ONE thing that really mattered the most — I showed up in the gym.

Once I was in the gym, I didn’t need the motivation.

This applies to almost every aspect of our life: be it writing, studying, cleaning...

Once we start a task we love, motivation becomes redundant.

Accomplishing a task without waiting for motivation spills over to other tasks too.

So, just start. Motivation will follow.

Would you choose to be motivation-dependent or motivation-independent?

"11 ways to handle (offensive) criticism:

1. Develop a thick skin; most criticisms don’t need your response.

2. Avoid psychoanalysing the person criticising you [“Oh they must be going through something really bad”]

3. Stop giving attention to criticism and focus solely on yourself and your goals.

4. Understand the nuances of criticism: feedback, critique, unsolicited criticism, sarcasm, abuses and insults. Ignore most of them.

5. Periodically cleanse your social media accounts of people that drain your energy.

6. Work on yourself. If 99% comments are positive and only 1% of negative comments agitate you, then you need to work on yourself.

7. Have the ability to laugh at past criticism. It gives us the courage to handle new criticism that may come our way.

8. Make allowances for your own and other person’s communication & contextual gaps.

9. Profit from criticism. Let the criticism fire you up to excel!

10. Accept that criticism is the digital exhaust of your social media engine.

11. Avoid making enemies out of strangers.

How do you handle criticism?

"Pro-tip for sending client proposals:

If you are charging an hourly rate,
Then in your proposal,
Mention the estimated time to complete the project.

This helps the client be aware of what total amount they can be expected to pay,
And saves the payment hesitation later.

For example:

₹1000 per hour
Estimated time: 6-8 hours*
*estimation only.

Then, the project cost for client would be ₹6000 - ₹8000 total.

How do you charge - per word, hour, or project?

"How to balance learning and execution:

1. Change word usage from the heavy ""Execution"" to light & easy ""Doing.”

2. Strive to INTEGRATE learning with doing, i.e. learning by trial & error. You learn on the job [and also get paid to learn!]

3. You could have all the knowledge in the world, but doing is the only way to find out if it works for YOU. Consider internships & other real work experience to validate your learnings.

4. Continuously learning new skills is overrated. Focus on layering your skills. For eg: If you are good at writing Instagram captions, layer this with graphic designing, running ads, etc.

People who have done something are always valued over people who claim to know something. [Also, you can always hire someone for specific skills.]

5. Realise that doing completes the cycle of learning.

"Potentially, each one of us is a content writer.

And freelancing, especially content writing, has very low entry barriers.

It does not require any certifications or credentials.

Because of these low barriers, freelancing is very crowded at the entry-level.

So, to make a mark for ourselves and stand out, we need to focus on surviving during the initial years.

During this time, we need to hustle by:

• Prospecting crazily

• Being disciplined enough to focus our efforts on ourselves and not get distracted by what life throws at us.

• Writing prolifically across diverse domains & niches on multiple platforms, and

• Having visibility in the virtual world by showcasing quantity & quality of writing.

We have to out-hustle, out-write and out-market ourselves on a daily basis.

Of course, as usual, there will be outliers here too.

Yet, for most of us, it’s about putting our nose to the grindstone and putting in the work for the initial 1-2 years.

Are you willing to survive for the initial 1-2 years?

"6 ways to improve your writing:

1. Create a structure. Then let your thoughts flow and write it all down.

2. Edit dispassionately and ruthlessly. You may have written an amazing line, but if it doesn’t belong here, edit it.

3. Emulate the style of your favourite writers. Check what works for them, and weave that style into your own writing.

4. Be open to feedback/ critique. Listen to any feedback you receive, even if you’re not going to work on it now.

5. Type out your favourite novel into a document. Elliot Chan typed out The Great Gatsby (47,000 words!) to understand the writer’s thoughts, choice of words and writing mechanics.

6. Identify what aspect of writing YOU want to improve upon, and look for resources suited for you.

"Pro-tip for productivity:

If you don’t like doing something
but really have to get it done,
Do it first thing in the morning.

Complete the task,
Get it out of your way,
And then do whatever you want to.

It boosts your confidence and sets you up nicely for other tasks of the day.

Just get it done!

"“Shreya, how much should I charge?”

So many of you message me your client details & scope of work and ask me how much you should charge.

If you are someone asking other people on how much to charge for your services, I would recommend you to NOT do that.

If you ask me how much to charge, I could probably tell you to go ahead and charge ₹50,000 per month for the scope of work.

BUT
If you are not comfortable with the price of ₹50,000,
If you are not able to convince & persuade the client for that rate,
If you are not able to carry that rate as YOURS,

Then you will NOT close the deal.

You will not close the deal even if the client had a budget for ₹50,000/-

Remember:
Your charges should be something you can OWN.

So experiment with your charges.

Start with something,
Update it with experience,
Find your sweet pricing range,
Find your pricing conviction.

How do you plan to discover your prices?

"Pro-tip for invoicing:

If you have negotiated with your client,
Mention that negotiated rate as a discount in your invoice.

Example:
Original rate = INR 10,000/-
Negotiated rate = INR 8,000/-

In your invoice, write:
INR 10,000
Less: discount @ 20%
-----------
INR 8,000

Benefits:

1. The client is aware of your original value and negotiation.
2. If the client is long-term and it comes to renewing the rates, your invoices will be an easy, indisputable reminder of the original rates.

Have you ever done this?

"“Never say no to money...”

This happened during my early freelancing days.

I spoke to a prospect for web copy.

The prospect said, “I’m travelling for a few days; I’ll pay ₹1000 now. I’ll pay the rest once I’m back next week.”

I thought: ₹1000 is a small amount.

So I emailed the prospect:
“It’s okay, you may pay the whole amount together.”

Later that day, I shared this conversation with my dad.

My dad said, “NEVER say no to money.”

I didn’t really understand what my dad meant.

Soon, it started to make sense.

The prospect stopped replying to my emails and the deal never happened.

That’s when I realised:

If I had accepted the “small” amount of ₹1000,
the prospect would have:
- been invested in the project
- not let his initial investment go waste
- completed the project & paid the balance amount.

By not accepting that ₹1000, I refused the client’s commitment to work with me.

This was a life-changing lesson.

What lesson(s) did you learn when you began freelancing?

"“I’m too young to start... ”

“I am young & don’t know what I want to do...”

“I’m a student. I’ll start after graduation...”


I strongly believe there is an unmatched power & sure-shot advantage in starting young.

When we start young, we start from ZERO, with not much to lose (other than our ego.)

When we start young, we can EXPERIMENT with 100 different things and find out the few things we are good at, & passionate about.

When we start young, we can work on MULTIPLE things at the same time since our other priorities are not as big.

When we start young, we gain EXPERIENTIAL knowledge & soft skills, which we keep honing with time.

When we start young, we can readily get HELP from friends, family & experts.

When we start young, we can afford to make MISTAKES & get away with most of them.

When we start young, we accumulate more years of real experience, giving us an undue ADVANTAGE that keeps compounding.


Should we figure everything out when we are young & look for guarantees?
No.

Should we start young & give ourselves the chance we deserve?
Yes!

When did you start?

"INR 501
INR 701
INR 801

These are some of the amounts paid for my ebook.

In India, it is considered auspicious to pay an amount that ends with 1.

Adding ₹1 makes the amount indivisible. So all the good luck and blessings remain indivisible.

That's why the gifting envelopes too have a ₹1 coin on them.

I was surprised to see this tradition being followed for my ebook too!

Another interesting thing here:

If I had priced the ebook as per prevailing norms of “499"" and ""799"", the readers may have skipped paying ₹1 extra to round it off.

Because (by luck) I priced my ebook at INR 500 (now INR 800),

I had the opportunity to witness an age-old tradition for a digital product!

The auspicious ₹1 was added voluntarily by the readers to a digital product!

Indeed, digital technology can be custodians of traditions!

Have you ever experienced such a tradition?

"Long drives taught me copywriting!

Sitting in the passenger's seat, I would read out the billboards whizzing by.

Sometimes, I would read one & tell my dad,
""That's so clever""

Other times I would say,
""The text is poorly aligned, I can't make any sense of it.""

Soon this became a habit.

""Wow, that really stands out""
""Why is their text yellow? I can't even see it""
""Is that an appropriate message by a brand?""

I did this for various kinds of ads: cars, insurance schemes, coffee powder, residential buildings...

Without realising, I was honing my copywriting skills & designing sensibilities.

This proved useful when I started writing ads.

I knew what to and what not to write,
I knew what the graphic should look like.

Now, when new writers ask me how to learn copywriting, I say:

1. Check existing ads (billboards, newspapers, social media)
2. Learn from the ads - why did they write that?
3. Improve upon the ads - what could they have done better?

The best part? As a newbie writer, you can also add some of your best suggestions to your portfolio!

What've you learnt through random daily activities?

"People stop doing what they love because they get discouraged by:
- no appreciation
- no immediate acceptance
- no comments
- no likes
- no payments
- no advance payments
- no full payments
- no work
- no market for them
- no clients for them
- no good clients for them
- no ‘high paying’ clients for them
- no instant gratification

You need to find ONE encouragement.

You need to find ONE client,
who pays you what you ask for,
who is easy to work with,
working with whom is an experience of a lifetime.

And once you find ONE such client,
You need to find just ONE more amongst billions of people out there, and so on.

Get encouraged by the potential market size.
Get encouraged by the untapped opportunities.
Get encouraged to test your skills & learnings.
Get encouraged to give luck a chance.

Remember: in reality, all the discouragements are a filtering mechanism to filter out discouraged people.

You will pass through this filter only if you are NOT discouraged.

What discourages you? And what encourages you?

Awesome! Based on your Founder’s profile review, here’s my proposal. Fees: ₹₹₹

What do you mean by a collab?

“We have a lot of reach on YouTube and Facebook. We can help you get more views.”

Okay, how am I supposed to pay my bills in Dublin?

I’m so surprised by million-dollar companies working purely on “collabs.”

"“You charge too much for content”

Me, 1 year ago:
“Content writing is difficult, it requires hours and hours of research, writing skills, commitment, hard work...”

Me, now:
“I’m a premium content writer. Here are my testimonials. Please contact me if you’d like to work with me.”

Why did I change my response?

1. The other person doesn’t care how difficult something I do is. They just want to get things done for the least possible price.

2. For something to be valued, it doesn’t have to be difficult. Content writing is something I love — it’s not difficult; I’m fast at it; I’m good at it.

So,
Build your case,
Sell your achievements,
But stop justifying yourself everywhere.

"🇮🇳 A Very Happy Independence Day 🇮🇳

Super fun live chat yesterday with:
Digital Pratik
Divyanshu Damani
Raj Shamani
Vaibhav Sisinty

We talked about our experiences in school & college.

My views?

Make the most of every opportunity available in school/ college.

If you want to work on something by yourself, start doing it while in college.

• Set goals that you can meet every semester

• Set skilling goals like selling, copywriting, video editing, speaking

• Use your skills to pay your own fees/ rent if possible

This will help you:
• Have the experience of freelancing
• Build your self confidence by accomplishing your goals
• Win your family’s trust in your capabilities.

Then, once you’ve graduated, you will have:
• A portfolio of personal & academic accomplishments
• Your family’s trust & support.

For more — check out the video on YouTube!

"Last night, 11:45 pm, I was returning the gym's key at the reception.

The guard got talking — late-night workouts disrupt sleep!

I asked his name,
Paul had joined recently.
He’s from Latvia.

When I told him I study English & Philosophy,
He said he loves philosophy.

In his words, “Not the Aristotle, Plato philosophy. But the kind where we ask ourselves who we are, why we are, and how we can make the world better.”

He said, “The subjects are good, but especially in Latvia, they wouldn’t help make money...”

He added, “...unless you can write a book!”

I smiled. Then I realised, I'd already written one!

Paul went into the office, brought out a paper & pen. I wrote down my ebook’s name.

He was really curious about the concept of an ebook & said he'd love to check it out.

This was such a random conversation: gyms to philosophy to ebooks.

Lesson?
Talk to people
Be curious
Ask questions
Learn about them.

We never know where our conversations can lead us.

"My first freelancing gig brought me $75 for a 400-word article.

My next gigs were writing brochures & social media posts at negotiated prices.

During the early stages of freelancing, my gigs brought me the 50% advance but not the 50% balance.

Lately, 99.5% of my gigs have brought in 100% payment with complete client satisfaction.

This is what freelancing is — it’s an unpredictable yet exciting game.

You don’t know how your work came in today,
You don’t know where your work will come from tomorrow,
You don’t know how long the work will stick with you.

The best you can do?

Put your best content out there,
Stick to it long-term,
And make freelancing as predictable & stable as possible for yourself.

And yes, freelancing stability IS possible IF you embrace its unpredictability.

Make it work for you.

"Why did I price my ebook at ₹500+?

Surveys indicate that the sweet spot for an ebook is ₹150 - ₹300

My choices:

1. Price within the average price range & hope to achieve high sales numbers

2. Price at above the average price & accept less sales

I realised my ebook didn’t fit either of these categories.

My ebook is an #Anthology.

It is meant as a reference ebook on writing, LinkedIn marketing & freelancing.

The ebook is not meant to be ‘read’ or ‘consumed’ once; it’s meant for 'creation' and ‘practice.'

If the principles in the ebook are applied, you will not only develop your own writing style but will recover the price of ebook too.

Yes, not all books can be bestsellers;
Some can be best impacters.

And I hope my ebook would have that kind of an impact.

How do you price your products & services?

I was paid 2x, 3x my asking price!

Since 2 years my audience has seen my work & consistency: LinkedIn posts, Instagram sessions, responding to their messages...

My audience appreciates my content & work.

So now, they CHOOSE to pay more than I ask for.

That’s the power of building authentic, strong connections.

"I resumed gym last week…

Before the lockdown, I had been working out consistently.

Last week, I resumed working out at the gym.

I knew I was going to struggle with lifting heavy weights and I was mentally prepared to start from scratch.

Then, I was surprised...

I was able to lift the weight just fine,
But I was unable to grip the dumbbells.

Gripping a light, 2kg dumbbell was also painful.

I persisted,
And managed to hit bare minimum reps.

It took me a few days, and my grip — the foundation of any workout — is now steadily improving.

This “grip” applies to everything.

Discontinuity or a long break takes us back to where we started.

Be it
writing,
baking,
posting on LinkedIn, etc.

We may still be really good at those things, but what we’ve lost is the grip.

To get the grip back, we need to resume the task itself.

We need to make it through the inertia & pain and be committed to the task.

How do you get your grip back?

"Dear freelancers,

It’s good to value
- ourselves
- our work

Yet, if a prospective client deviates from OUR expectations, it does not mean they:
- don’t value us
- are being unfair.

Let’s accept that the prospects understand their businesses well and can make their own decisions to fulfil their requirements.

Sometimes there are things that we may not like or agree to.

But things are what they are.
If it suits us, we can take it up.
If not, we can say no & move on.

Of course, rule of land shall always prevail.

"You are paid for your mindset.

“How can I get more clients?”
“How can I make more money?”
“How can I take up more projects?”
“How can I improve my skills?”

We ask all these questions every single day.

But something EVERY freelancer ignores: Mindset.

EVERYTHING we do begins with our mindset.

Our mindset sets up our process.

Our mindset persists when there is resistance or inertia.

The right mindset can:
- make freelancing 10x easier
- make you 10x richer
- help you achieve 10x goals
- bring you happiness & satisfaction.

So, identify your strengths and weaknesses.
Work on your mindset.

What helps you achieve 10x goals?

"These are not normal times.

Each one of us is fighting our own battles.

And we may be unaware of what battle someone else is fighting.

Above all, founders and entrepreneurs are hit the hardest due to increasing uncertainty and lack of revenues.

The increasing uncertainty and lack of revenues affect the company, the team and their families.

It’s during these difficult times that freelancers should come across as blessings to the startup and business ecosystem.

As a freelancer, avoid being stubborn.

Stubbornness makes us:
- resentful of any normal ask or request
- rigid, and makes us focus only on ourselves & our needs
- maintain the status quo and unwillingness to budge from stated position.

Most of times our stubbornness is not because we are personally losing anything of consequence,

Rather,
because it makes us feel powerful by refusing to do something for others.

But, there’s a time for everything.

And now... now is not the time to be stubborn.

Can you be a blessing to your client during these times?

#ShreyaWrites

P.S. Be stubborn on vision but flexible on details.

"Marketing for a marketing agency???

Some of my clients are social media marketing agencies.

For these agencies, I cover all social media marketing:
- strategy
- copywriting
- graphics
- scheduling, etc

Initially, I found it odd: marketing for a marketing agency...?

But then I realised: marketing is tough.

And when you’re already doing it for others, you tend to neglect your own marketing.

Don’t do this.

Prioritise your marketing.

Focus on:
- building your visibility;
- prospecting consistently;
- grabbing opportunities
- working on YOUR OWN brand.

Your brand matters.

Don’t neglect yourself. Don’t neglect your branding.

Are you working on your brand?

"What Apple taught me about pricing...

I broke my phone a few days ago.

The next morning, I went to the store.

I looked around and found the phone that suited my requirements.

Then, I had 3 options:
1. 64 GB (€ X)
2. 256 GB (€ X + 170)
3. 512 GB (€ X + 400)

Without thinking much, I went for the second option: 256 GB.

Why?
1. 64 GB was too less for me
2. There was no option for 128 GB
3. The only sensible choice was 256 GB, even if that meant paying more.

And that’s exactly why Apple did not create the 128 GB model. Because that’s the intermediate - one that EVERYONE would go for.

So, by skipping the 128 GB option, Apple made our decision for us.

How can you apply this pricing strategy to your business?

"“Have a good weekend!”

My favourite part about Friday is sending the week’s updates and texting my clients “Have a great weekend!”

It’s been a busy (& satisfying) week, and I look forward to a great weekend myself!

Have a good weekend everyone!

"Phone calls are overrated.
Texts/emails are underrated.

This is how I share work updates with my clients:

1. WhatsApp message
2. Email
3. Tag them on the Google Doc

Calls? Zero.

If things can be done over text and can save your client’s (and your) time, don’t set up a call.

Plus, the written word stays longer than the spoken word.

Keep things simple.

How do you update your client?

"My 1-hour client call went on for 2 hours.

I NEVER take such long calls.

But this was okay.

Why?

1. This was our FIRST call in months.
2. We reviewed the work so far, and finalised the next steps. No more calls needed for another few months!
3. The call was meaningful and every minute was wisely used.
4. I pitched for an additional service & bagged the deal.

The point is: be adaptable if you want good things to happen.

Calls may extend, you may work on the weekends, you may negotiate more than expected.

And that’s okay.

As long as it’s meaningful for you & your client, be open to stepping beyond your comfort zone at times.

Would you step beyond your comfort zone?

"“How do you manage the positive & negative comments?,” asked Hardik Patni.

Over the years, I have received a lot of positivity — I’m really lucky that people appreciate my work.

I really appreciate everyone who comments positively, and also those who send me very kind, long, personal messages.

When it comes to criticism, I accept it.

Yet, sometimes, people comment something that’s not relevant, and not even sensible for that post…

Earlier, I would get agitated.

Now, I am okay.

Now I understand they are just a part of life, and they help keep me grounded.

I mean, if it were all good, it wouldn’t be real!

"The Freelancing Mindset: Everyday starts with 0

I am not a mindset expert.

Yesterday, I spoke about MY understanding of the freelancing mindset.

🤔 What is the freelancing mindset?

Positivity? No. It’s being real!

🚫 Avoid these 3 mindsets:

1. The undervaluing mindset
2. The victim mindset
3. The entitled mindset

✅ Nurture this mindset:

1. Make YOUR order in the chaos.
2. Work towards changing YOUR freelancing reality
3. Be prepared for anything
4. Maintain your composure
5. Don’t take things personally

"Getting internships made easy!

Asking your friends and family for internships is SO underrated.

If you are looking for an internship,
Ask your:
Parents
Grandparents
Uncles & aunts
Cousins
Neighbours
Friends
Friends’ parents
Teachers & Professors
Tutors…

They may get you an interview opportunity in their network.
Of course, then the rest is all up to you.

Leverage what you have: your personal network!

Other ways that also work:
- Advertised openings
- Cold emails
- Social media network

"“Even American writers don’t charge that much!”

So?

What does being a writer have anything to do with where I’m from?

You can’t choose an attribute of your choice to pay me less.

Foreign countries don't set the pricing standard.
We content creators do.

I’m a Content Writer.
My work meets global standards.
That’s all that should matter.

"“Why stress over problems that can be solved with money?”

It was my birthday yesterday.

This was my first birthday away from home, alone.

I didn’t have any plans for the day. But life did.

At 2am, I dropped my phone, and it broke.

That was it.
I kept staring at the huge black patch on the screen and started tearing up.

3am
4am
5am
Berating myself and losing sleep.

At 5:30am, I called my dad,
“I broke my phone screen.”

My dad laughed.

“Why are you losing sleep over a problem that can be solved with money? Get it fixed tomorrow, or buy a new phone.”

I was so, so surprised.

No scoldings?
No anger?
No second thoughts?

“Just sleep now. Go to the store in the morning,” said my parents.

In a few minutes, I slept. Peacefully.

Later that day, I bought a new phone.

I learnt a very important lesson on my birthday: some things are just not worth stressing over.

Of course, I value what I have. And I am very fortunate to have what I have.

Yet, accidents happen.

What do you think is not worth losing sleep over?

"“LinkedIn is not Instagram!”

To all those who demand “professionalism” because “LinkedIn is not Instagram”:

Instagram has COUNTLESS amazing content creators.

Instagram has NUMEROUS storytellers.

Instagram has a TON of valuable information.

It’s not about the platform,
It’s about WHO you follow,
And WHAT content you consume.

Social media platforms are a treasure trove for learning and earning.

The quality of your content curation decides the quality of your life.

It’s up to you where you give your attention.

Curate & filter your feed everyday; avoid scrolling only for entertainment.

So, what will you focus on: the platform or the people?

"“Speak over the phone before hiring anyone.”

A few months ago, I started building my team.

How did I hire?

I came across LinkedIn posts by content creators “Looking for projects”

I asked them for work samples,
Checked their work samples,
And if I liked the samples, I hired them.

And soon, slippages in work started.

A few weeks in, I spoke to my dad about my team not working out long-term.

I shared my selection process.

He asked, “Did you speak to them? Over the phone?”

Silence…

“Always speak over the phone before hiring anyone,” he said.

From that instant I overhauled my recruitment process.

Speaking over the phone (even if for just 10 minutes,)
Gave me a new insight into the writer & their work ethics.
And the writers too got to know my expectations on the deliverables.

Now, I’ve stuck with my new team for months together.

Indeed, a phone call works wonders.

How do you hire/join a team?

#ShreyaWrites

P.S. Pick up the phone and talk to the candidate. Give them the verbal handshake and build that relationship so they will trust you.

"On this day, last year, I got my laser eye surgery.

I am reliving how my mom read out LinkedIn posts to me after my surgery...

(Sharing last year’s post)

After the surgery, my eyes were shut for ~3 days.

So, my mom read out my emails, texts & LinkedIn notifications twice a day.

While she was at it, she also read out a few LinkedIn posts by Ashi, Hardik, Sandeep & more.

While I heard her 'narrate' the posts, I realised how much the form of storytelling has evolved digitally.

That's what I mean when I say: add value through your posts by sharing personal stories... they are the best kind to read.

But, this post is more than about LinkedIn.

Shoutout to my mom for keeping up with 100s of my LinkedIn notifications.

Shoutout to my mom for taking care of her grown-up daughter who had turned into a new born baby.

Shoutout to my mom for being the amazing woman she is & looking after me day & night.

Made it through this week only thanks to her :)

Psst... I also won the #careerstory competition! Thanks all for your kind wishes!

What are your special memories with your mom?

"“That company is only paying INR 5,000 per month for internships!”

Yes, and that’s okay.

You are an intern.
You are identifying the skill you are good at.
You are learning.
You are a part of a team.
You are experiencing & improving.

As an intern, you take up the offer for the learning opportunity.

You explore your potential, aptitude and interests.

Your internship is a failure if:
- you can showcase only your monetary earnings
- you take it up only to meet the academic requirements

Your internship is successful if you have improved your:
- soft skills
- presentation skills
- learnings skills by observing, inquiring & questioning.

Your internship is successful if:
- you are viewed as an asset to the organisation
- you gain the confidence to take on the world.

Yes yes, you must value yourself and your work.

But first, learn to value the experience by learning.

So stop focusing only on the internship stipend,
And focus on the learning opportunities!

Enjoy your internship!

What did you learn from your internship?

#ShreyaWrites

P.S. Not learning by doing, but learning by risking.

"""Hi"" is overrated,
""Thank you"" is underrated.

I work with many freelancers.

Writers,
Graphic designers,
Video editors,
Web developers.

How do I know if they are a good fit?
How do I know if I can work with them long-term?

Their words of acknowledgement.

I process the payment,
Share the screenshot with the freelancer.

Normally, the response is:
“Received payment, thank you.”

Sometimes, the response is: 
“Okay”
“Cool”
“Received”

And… it’s odd. Really odd.

Some things are never outdated.
Saying thanks tops that list.

Someone filled in your survey?
Someone gave you feedback on content?
Someone confirmed the deal?
Someone set up a call on a weekend?

Say “Thank you.”
Always say “Thank you.”

If you want to stand out,
Say thanks & acknowledge others.

Be courteous.
Be kind.

Do you say ""thank you""?

#ShreyaWrites

P.S. Anyone too busy to say thank you will get fewer and fewer chances to say it.

"“Dad, I was selected for the internship last week, and now they say I am NOT”

I‘d been to an interview in Churchgate (Mumbai.)

I was asked to join from the next week; that I would receive the offer letter by email.

A whole week went by.

I finally called the company.
The receptionist said, “The selections are done. You are not selected.” She hung up.

She didn’t ask my name.
She didn’t ask when I’d given the interview.
She didn’t wait for my response.

I was shocked.
And immensely disappointed.

I went up to my dad & screamed about the unprofessionalism, immorality & indecency of the company.

My dad’s reply?
“Move on.”

I stared at my dad furiously.

The next day, I stopped thinking of the failed situation & started applying for new internships. I finally got an amazing offer from the Times Network.

Everyone talks about moving on from people and relationships. Moving on from interviews is equally important.

If you don’t move on, how will you date again?
I mean… how will you find a new opportunity?

Thanks for this lesson, dad.

What’s the best lesson you’ve learnt from your dad?

"I grew up in a family where business discussions were quite common.

Identifying problems,
Strategising solutions,
Marketing,
Raising funds,
Team management,
Winning & retaining customers…
I have found all these things fascinating from a young age.

">> New podcast interview alert! <<

I met David Watters at a pitching workshop in Trinity.

I was preparing for the Dragon’s Den Finals,
And David was invited to advise us on our presentations.

When I completed my pitch,

The first thing David said was,

“I saw all the slide-decks last night. And I remembered yours so distinctly.”

I was delighted to hear that my presentation was memorable.

He then gave me some very, very useful advice:

“Be enthusiastic about your idea. But while presenting, talk patiently and clearly.”

Later that week, I presented at the Dragon’s Den Finals and won my first funding!

This was back in February.
And it changed my life!

So when David messaged me last week for an interview on his podcast, I knew I had to say yes!

Listen to this podcast, where I talk about moving to Dublin, content writing, freelancing, ideating my startup and winning my first funding!

"My content writing rates are premium.

My work is premium.
My rates are premium.

This means, I say “no” a lot.

This also means,
When I say “yes,”
I am working with the best clients.

I now realise that clients who pay a premium rate know exactly what they want.

Such clients know it takes time to create something meaningful and lasting.

So they are in it for the long haul.
Short-term doesn’t work for them.

Such clients are demanding.
Only the best posts are accepted by them.

Such clients want the best outcome.
They improve my creativity and push me towards the best.

Such clients value their personal brand.
And they are willing to invest worth that value.

Such clients make my life easy.
They pay on time and maintain high professional standards.

I do say “no” a lot.

But when I say “yes,”
Such clients turn my life around!

Are your freelancing charges premium?

"Can offering a discount make your client considerate?

No. The client doesn’t owe you gratitude.

I quote my fee to a client.

They think it over,
Share their financial concerns,
And ask for discounts.

I do understand the challenges.

So,
Sometimes,
I offer a discount.

We begin the work.

And then I notice:

Delayed advance payment
Delay in sharing information
No timely responses
Dissatisfaction with all work
…

At these points I think,
“I offered a heavy discount,
The least the client can do is cooperate.”

But I was wrong.

Offering the discount was my decision.

And the client does not owe me any cooperation for my decision.

They will be the way they want to be.

They may even have valid reasons to be the way they want to be.

Do you expect your clients to be extra-considerate for offering them discounts?

"“Shreya, you didn’t write the content, you just edited it...”

Sometimes the client provides a draft content which is rich & complete.

If the client’s content is good,
Do I need to change the content just for the sake of it?

If the client’s brief is well-written,
Especially something like the “About Us” section,
Do I need to forcefully add new lines to it?

Should I create content to “make it seem like I have done my job,”
Even if the overall impact would be reduced compared to the original content?

This is such a dilemma.

But, then I remember what my job is:
To provide quality content.

If that means editing a few lines rather than writing new ones,
So be it.

Are you professional enough to accept the integrity of the original content?

"When it takes a year to close a deal!

The year: June 2019

A prospect messages me for LinkedIn Marketing.

We discuss details.

And nothing happens... no progress is made.

Fast forward to: June 2020

I share about my client’s LinkedIn post going viral.

The previous prospect messages me again.

We discuss the details.

The prospect is now my client!

Who knew, some deals would take a year to close!

Remember: A prospect is your prospect for a lifetime, or till they become your client.

Showcasing your client success stories is a very credible form of persuasion.

Highlight what you have done and how you have helped your clients.

"“I procrastinate a lot,"" shared Jerry Jenkins, author of 190+ books. ""But my deadline is sacred.""

And I agree with Jenkins.

This is how I write my university essays:

I get my essay topic.

For days and weeks,
I just jot down a few points,
I create an outline.

And I don’t get past that.

The essay skips my mind.

Finally,
48 hours before the deadline,
I turn that outline into an essay.

And I submit it on time.

How does that happen?

How, after all the procrastination,
Do I submit my essay on time?

That’s because I don’t have a choice.

There’s a deadline.
A sacred deadline.

Whether I write 100 words everyday for 15 days,
Or I write 1500 words in an hour,

No matter HOW I do it,
I know I have to get the essay done by the deadline.

The same process exists for multiple things:

- Write 3 articles by 4pm.
- Complete my workout by 10pm
- Read this book by Friday night.

And that’s how I get things done.

Procrastinate. A lot.
But stick to my sacred deadline.

Is your deadline sacred?

"Freelancers need to stop feeling bad for wanting money.

This is how we freelancers talk:

“I want to follow my passion”

“I want to be happy”

“I want to learn more”

“I want to gain experience”

“It’s all about the journey”

NOBODY talks directly about money.

NOBODY says, “I want to make money “

Why not?

Money pays for our:
Roti (food)
Kapda (clothes)
Makaan (house)
Education
Healthcare
Travel
Wifi...

Money makes us independent.

Money gives us the freedom to do the things we want.

When we have money,
We can give the people around us the best of things.

So, set money goals.

Be okay with wanting money.

After all, only money can solve your money problems.

"My client’s post went viral!

Last week, my client’s post went viral... 1300+ likes!

It’s wonderful to know that the process that works for me, works for my clients too.

My client shared his post's performance regularly, and his delight was contagious.

He told me he couldn’t stop looking at the post!

Honestly, his delight reminded me of the time when my post went viral the first time.

I would keep checking my phone,
Scrolling through the comments,
And refreshing the post again & again.

Yes, I know... I said that you’re supposed to move on from your posts.

But as you move on,
Don’t forget to cherish the posts too.

You’ve worked hard,
You’ve been consistent,
Your content has touched the readers emotionally.

Good engagement is the reward you deserve for being consistent!

Celebrate your consistency...
By continuing to be consistent :)

You should.

By setting an income goal, you know how much more you need to prospect, make calls and change marketing tactics to hit that number.

Here’s how you can set your income goal:

#Step1 Identify the skillset(s) you can monetise:
 Eg. Content Writing, Social Media Marketing, LinkedIn Marketing

#Step2 Define your goal:  “I will make ₹—— by 30th June 2020.”

How can you fill in the blank?

🔸Consider your monthly expenses (rent, groceries phone bill, travel, etc.) Aim to earn at least that much
OR
🔸Look at your performance in May. Strive to maintain this income, or increase by 10-20%

[Suppose you earned ₹10,000 in May, your goal for June should be ₹11,000- ₹12,000]

#Step3 How do you achieve this goal?

🔸Break it down into chunks: “I will make ₹10,000 by having X clients paying me ₹1000 every Yth day…”

🔸Monthly retainers

🔸Any other format that works for you.

Are you ready to set & achieve your income goals?

"What is a book?

An excerpt from the 11th episode of Carl Sagan’s 1980s Cosmos series, “The Persistence of Memory”:

“What an astonishing thing a book is.

It’s a flat object made from a tree with flexible parts on which are imprinted lots of funny dark squiggles.

But one glance at it and you’re inside the mind of another person, maybe somebody dead for thousands of years.

Across the millennia, an author is speaking clearly and silently inside your head, directly to you.

Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions, binding together people who never knew each other, citizens of distant epochs. Books break the shackles of time.

A book is proof that humans are capable of working magic.”

What does a book mean to you?

"Need: Website content. Budget: $1.

Yesterday, a prospect scheduled a call through my website.

He was looking for website content.

The details seemed okay...

Until I saw the budget: USD 1

I was VERY surprised. $1? Really?

I thought it could have been an error,
So I emailed the prospect:

“Thanks for scheduling a call through my website... Kindly confirm whether your budget is indeed USD 1, in which case, we cannot proceed further.

If you do have a reasonable & realistic budget, I request you to share further details.”

Soon, he responded:
“I can only pay ₹0.10 per word for content. Is that feasible for you?”

Umm... what?

Was this really happening?

I politely declined his offer.

I added: “I request you to pay writers worth their work & time.”

So yes.
That happened.

From 1000-word articles for $4,
To website content for $1...

I’ve seen some CRAZY things in my freelancing career!

What’s the CRAZIEST offer you’ve received?

#ShreyaWrites

P.S. If you deal with the lowest bidder, it is well to add something for the risk you run. And if you do that, you will have enough to pay for something better.

"✅ #How to follow up with emails/texts:

“Awaiting your go ahead.”

“Looking forward to your response.”

“When shall we kickstart the project?”

“I hope we are ready to start our work now.“

“Kindly indicate if you need any additional clarifications/details?”

“I look forward to beginning the project by this weekend/on this date.”

“How do you prefer to pay: by bank transfer or PayPal?“

❌ How #NOT to follow up with emails/texts:

“Can I expect a response?”

“You can at least reply.”

“Why haven’t you replied?”

“You said you’d respond by Monday, it’s now Thursday.”

“I have other offers too, let me know if you don’t want to work together.”

📍Usually, you need 4-5 response tactics to close the deals successfully.

Experiment, and use follow-up strategies that work well for you.

Remember: always be respectful & empathetic in your follow-up emails.

How do you follow up?

"Don’t plagiarise. Ever.

First, what is plagiarism?
Presenting someone else’s work as your own.

What is NOT plagiarism?
Quoting some lines by others and mentioning their name for credits.

Never ever plagiarise.

If you employ a team, check it for plagiarism.

If your article is ghostwritten, double check it for plagiarism.

Plagiarism can destroy years of your fame, trust and credibility.

If you find your piece is plagiarised, take it down or delete it.

And give an unqualified apology.

Don’t justify your plagiarised piece.

Don’t defend your actions over plagiarism.

Don’t plagiarise.

"Once you hit “post” on a piece of content, your job is done.

If the post resonates with people, it will do well. It’s done.

If the post doesn’t do well, it doesn’t matter. It’s done.

Don’t keep looking at the numbers,
Don’t overthink about the content,
Don’t question if you could have written it better.

Move on and focus on the next piece.

Do the next one better.

Do you move on from your posts?

"My best advice to new writers: stop looking for advice.

As a beginner, you may be contacting established content writers to seek advice about starting out as a writer.

This is not as helpful as you’d want it to be.

At this point, you haven’t identified what aspects of writing you want to strengthen, so your questions tend to be vague (and unhelpful.)

So, instead of seeking advice, do your part — start writing.

Write every day, keep practicing, commit to it.

Then, after identifying EXACTLY what you need help with, approach other writers for advice.

Just remember to take the first step on your own.

[An excerpt from Pawan Kumar’s latest article — link in comments.]

"“Regarding LinkedIn… when you met Jeff Weiner, the CEO of LinkedIn, did he give you a secret key to generate such an amazing engagement on LinkedIn?”

I met Jeff at a college event. I told him, ""I’m a student and don’t know how to use LinkedIn to get an internship.”

He asked, “What’s your dream job?”

When I paused, he said, “You need to break your goals down and you need to be very specific as to what you want in life.”

And that absolutely cleared things up for me.

The reason his advice helped was that I ACTED on it and went very specific with LinkedIn.

I have been committed to LinkedIn for these one and a half years, so I’m getting what I’m getting today… all because I narrowed it down to one thing.

"Blessed to have clients like this...

I do LinkedIn Marketing for a client.

The client regularly texts me his post ideas & notes.

I create the post and send it back.

When we complete a month of work, I send him next month's invoice for advance payment.

And the process repeats.

In these 6 months of working with my client,
I have done ZERO follow-ups for content or payments.

Invoices are paid on time.
Ideas are exchanged smoothly & meaningfully.
I give cues when needed, and the content keeps rolling.

Because the client is proactive, the process becomes seamless.

I save a lot of time.
I put my best work forward.

And I absolutely enjoy working with this client!

Do you have such wonderful client stories?

"When I began posting on LinkedIn, I would write and rewrite for days & days for the ‘perfect’ story.

I would write a post,
Rewrite it,
Edit it,
Proofread it,
Get ready to post it,
Ask myself whether it was good enough,
And then...
Just before hitting “Post”...
I would rewrite it.
Again.

I always wanted my stories to be perfect.

Then I realised...

Creating content is not about writing down the perfect story.

Creating content is about sharing the many stories I have to tell.

My content is all about my journey, my processes, my experiences... MY story.

And now, that’s all I do. Share my story.

What do you share— stories or perfect stories?

"How to charge for content writing?

Per #word

Benefits:
- Get paid for exactly what you write

Challenges:
- No advance payment
- Uncertain final word count, hence unpredictable pay

Per #hour

Benefits:
- Helpful when the scope of work is not clearly defined
- Possibility of advance payment for a certain number of hours

Challenges:
- Hourly rates turn into large numbers quickly
- Client may not be prepared for large numbers & hence renegotiate later.

Per #project

Benefits:
- Full advance payment possible
- Income clearly defined

Challenges:
- Pressure to complete the task
- More responsibility & accountability towards content quality & delivery.

So, how do you plan to charge?

#ShreyaWrites

P.S. Competing with everyone: $10/hr
Competing with a few: $100/hr
Selling a product: $1,000/hr
Building equity: $10,000/hr

"For content writing, I have studied only 2 books in my lifetime:

1. 'Cashvertising' by Drew Eric Whitman
2. 'On Writing' by Stephen King

But, I have read these books many times.

I pick these books almost every other day.

The truth is: the number of books you read doesn’t matter.

What matters is how many times you read those books, and what you learn from them.

You don’t read books because you own them…

You read books TO own them.

Repetition is key to learning.
Repeated reading is the way.
Re-read the books until they become a part of you.

"Content writing is a team sport.

Your client and you are in the same team.

And the prize is winning the best content.

So, involve your client in the writing process.

Yes, you have been hired to write for your client.

But your client knows their brand and requirements the best.

More importantly, your client knows what they want their content to achieve.

Not sure what to write?
Contact your client.

Brief is unclear?
Contact your client.

Confused about the content’s purpose?
Contact your client.

Ask for more information.
Ask for references.
Ask for their input.
Ask for clarifications.
Ask for cooperation.

Content writing is a collaborative process.

Always, always, always involve the client in your process.

Get your client to invest beyond money.

"Last week, I was working on an ad copy.

Spent hours working on the one-liner ad.

Wrote down variations of the same copy.

Kept working on it over and over and over.

Finally decided to send the document to the client.

And right before sending it,

In the last minute,

I thought of a new, very simple copy and added it.

Sent the document…

And the client instantly selected the last-minute copy I wrote.

It is now their campaign slogan!

Sometimes, it takes hours to create something magical in one minute!

Has this ever happened to you?

"I lost my summer internship.

And I am not the only one to lose an internship, placement or job opportunity.

If you have lost your work offer due to Covid-19, you can still make the most of the opportunity.

Send this email to the employer.
Here’s a template:

Hi [name],

I hope you are well.

I request you to provide me with a letter indicating that [company name] had offered me an internship, but it was cancelled due to the Covid-19.

The letter would be immensely helpful for references & recommendations for future opportunities.

Thank you very much.

Take care,

"Writing is like cycling.

You can’t learn cycling by reading about it.

The number of hours you spend reading about cycling is irrelevant...

Until you START cycling.

You fall down,
You scrape your elbows & knees,
You get hurt...

But if you keep at it, eventually, you will learn to balance well.

That’s how you learn cycling... and writing.

Writing can be improved only by writing.

Yes, the fundamentals like grammar & vocabulary may be learnt through reading.

But if you want to improve writing, practice it.

For every hour of reading, spend at least 10 hours writing.

If you need inspiration, read for 15-20 minutes and then start writing.

Eventually you won’t need an external inspiration to write.

Of course, reading for learning, academics and enjoyment have a different context.

But if you want to improve a skill, be consistent in DOING and practising, rather than just reading.

"“Shreya, how do you deal with failure?”

The same way I deal with my success.

I call my parents.

I say, “This happened today...”

They say, “It’s okay, what’s next?”

They make me see all the other things waiting for me.

They make me realise there are still a million things worth chasing.

They make me want to get up and chase those things.

And that’s how I deal with failure and success... by having my parents help me accept it.

"Speed is an underrated skill.

My typing speed has boosted my content creation speed.

Speed reading helps me in faster research.

Quickly navigating between different tabs has become effortless.

All this has resulted in getting more things done.

Yes, practice helps improve the skills.

But practice also helps:
- improve productivity,
- improve focus, and
- avoid distractions.

To master your skills, practice relentlessly.

Practice with intent and speed.

"I would not have hired myself.

I’ve been reading my old writings.

My flaws are so obvious that I can’t imagine I would have written them.

If I could go back in time,
I would only change one thing:

EDIT. A LOT.

Earlier, I would write everyday.

But I wouldn’t spend time polishing my work.

So my old writings lacked the
Intent,
Core idea,
Structure &
Shine.

Now, my writing is mainly editing, editing and more editing.

After all this, still more editing.

Yet I continue to be a student of writing, and a very keen learner.

Honestly, I would be disappointed if I like my current writings in 2023.

After all, stagnation is decay.

Growth is possible only when you keep building upon the present.

What do you think about your older work?

"Why steal posts?

Why copy?

Why plagiarise?

Using “#copiedpost” is NOT giving credit.

Sharing the writer’s name AFTER the entire post is NOT giving credit.

Blocking the writer is NOT giving credit.

If you like a post so much,

1. Reshare the post
or
2. Tag the writer on the TOP of the post.

Copy-pasting may be just a post update for you...

For us writers, our posts are:
- What we are
- What we do
- What we live for
- What we want to be remembered for
- An inseparable part of us.

Stop stealing. Give credits.

"A session over WhatsApp AUDIO notes?

Yes, I did that on 18th April!

I conducted a session for students of a Nigerian University— University of Lagos.

Isaac Melchizedek messaged me last week.

He asked me to conduct a webinar...

“Launching a Career as a 21st Century Writer”

He said, “We’ll do it over WhatsApp!”

I was intrigued.

I asked him about a video webinar, over a video conferencing app.

He said that many students face internet issues.

So, we did it on WhatsApp.

- I joined a group of 120+ students

- I sent many short audio notes

- I stayed in that group for 24 hours

- Students asked me questions in those 24 hours.

I’ve realised:

Nothing should stop you from doing the things you love. And I love conducting sessions.

And even a poor internet bandwidth cannot stop you from learning.

There’s always a way.

Find it.

"He made ₹24,00,000 (₹24 lacs) in 24 hrs!

Puneet Rao is a fitness coach.

He has 31,000 followers on Instagram.

He owns a gym.

During the lockdown, his gym has been shut.

So he conducted FREE live workout sessions on Instagram for 3 weeks.

3 days ago, he started a one-month long online workout program.

Fee: ₹2000 per person, per month

And in 24 hours,

1200 people registered!

And just like that...

BOOM!

₹24,00,000 in his bank account!

What did Puneet do right?

1. Understood & leveraged the business side of his passion for health & fitness

2. Built a community of like-minded people on Instagram

3. Conducted Live workout sessions for FREE; earned trust & credibility

4. Provided real & tangible value in the virtual world

5. Priced his training program perfectly & donated 10% of the earnings.

This “overnight success” took him 10 years of commitment to fitness & Instagram.

So... commit to what you’re good at, and HUGE results will come.

"I recruit writers secretly.

That’s right.

I have been growing my team.

Slowly.
Steadily.
Secretly.

Many new writers message me for guidance.

I give them advice and help them out.

They thank me.

The conversation stops.

BUT...

The connection doesn’t stop.

I then follow their posts for a few weeks.

I check the content they are putting out.

I check whether they are improving.

I check whether they are following my advice.

I look for skill, growth & passion.

And I find that... in some people.

So I message them.

“Would you like to write for me?”

And they almost instantly say yes.

That’s how I recruit writers.

Lesson?

And not do much work.

"I have 7977 pictures on my phone.

Over the past few days, I’ve scrolled through every single one of them.

I‘ve found it very soothing and calming.

Just by looking at each picture, I could recall:

My thoughts when I took the picture...

The fragrance in the room...

How cold the weather was...

My favourite song at the time...

The feeling of being in a particular place...

The things that led up to that moment...

The after-the-click moments...

A picture brings out so many memories.

And this is such a beautiful time to relive those memories.

There is so much to be thankful for!

Try it: scroll through your images, and tell me what you recall.

Will you give it a shot?

"Once, there lived a little boy.

He found a seed.

He planted it & dreamed of savouring the mangoes it would yield.

Days passed.
So did weeks, months, and years.

Then... a little ball, as crimson as the hue of the dawning sun, hung on the once-little-tree's branch.

The boy, not-so-little anymore, spotted this sphere from a few feet below.

He climbed the branches,
Met a few ants & cobwebs,
Caught hold of the fruit,
And huddled back down.

As soon as his feet touched the soft grass, he expected to see a mango in his hand.

It was an orange.

He was shattered. He was angry.

Instantly, he hated the tree.

He wanted to get rid of it so he wouldn't be reminded of his foolishness.

He lifted his axe and began chopping down the tree.

He kept thinking how the tree had deceived him.

He got angry & upset, and kept swinging his axe.

Then, it struck him:
The tree wasn't a mango tree at all.
It was an orange tree.

No amount of care or love could make an orange tree grow mangoes.

He let down the axe.

He brought some water, nurtured the tree again.

And finally, he learnt to savour the sweetness of an orange.

"What if all your content disappears???

I've been sharing content online for years.

I've posted on a dozen different platforms.

I've spent hours and hours creating original content.

I've spent even more time on getting myself known for that content.

And sometimes, all I can think is:

What if, one day, it's all gone?

After all... only the profiles belong to me, and not the platform.

And finally,
After all the thinking,
After all this time,

I have my own website!

Now,
I create content,
I share what I create,
I own what I share.

Check out my brand new website! Link in comments!

"People are losing their jobs.

Students are struggling with their graduation.

Migrants are walking 100s of kilometres to be home.

Doctors are saving strangers and video calling their kids.

Patients are spending days and weeks in hospitals, alone.

Families are mourning the loss of their loved ones.

Souls are leaving their bodies, with no one to hug one last time.

And us?

Look at us.

Whining about “getting bored” at home.

Crying over a slower internet.

Bothered by not having enough movies on Netflix.

Craving to hit the gym suddenly.

Needing that white-mermaid-cup latte.

Hoarding on toilet paper and soap.

Wanting the fresh air for our soul.

Stepping out on the 5th day, because “I’ve been in for 4 whole days!”

While we crib over how difficult our life is, there are people out there who only wish they could be home.

People who wish they could be safe.

People who wish they could hold their family. At least one last time.

And us?

We have what these people wish for.

Cherish it. Stay home.

"21 February 2018.

I checked my email.

New email from Trinity College Dublin.

“Congratulations on your offer!”

This was it: I was selected by one of the best colleges for English and Philosophy.

My dad ran around the house, screaming “YES YOU GOT IT!!!”

My mom kept asking “What happened???”

Then both of them jumped around the house.

They shrieked, “WE KNEW IT!”

I was the one selected, yet they both were so much more happier than me!

It’s been over 2 years since that day.

And at times like these, when I feel that everything’s crashing down...

I just think about the times when I made it...

And how happy my parents were when I made it.

It’s memories like these,
Of the glow on my parents’ faces,
That keep me going in tough times.

What keeps you going?

"I am getting comfortable with not stepping out.

But life has a habit of giving surprises.

Today, my laptop charger has given up on me, amidst the lockdown.

I was worried for a moment... then I ordered a new charger online.

I’m so grateful for online shopping and express delivery. And I’m more thankful to all the people who make this possible.

"“Shreya, did Covid-19 affect the number of clients you normally get?”

Here’s what my days in isolation have been like:

Days 1-5:
Confirmed deals were put on hold

Days 6-11:
I assumed no one would give work right now, so I spent time binge-watching, resting, sleeping

Days 12-15:
Decided to give it a shot; spent time on LinkedIn and booked new calls

Days 16-18:
Closed 6 deals; received payment from 4 clients already

Day 19...
Work is as usual for me.

Lesson?

Times may change, but don’t let the time change how you work.

Keep doing your bit, and things will work out.

How do you plan to face the situation?

"""Hi Shreya, can you give me a LinkedIn Premium membership?""

In the last 3 days, 14 people have asked me this.

Sorry, I cannot give you a Premium membership because I am not a LinkedIn employee, and don't have those privileges.

But, what I CAN give you is some very real advice:

You do NOT need a Premium account to get good opportunities.

You do NOT need a Premium account to connect with the right people.

You do NOT need a Premium account to make more money.

What you need to do instead is:

1. Update your profile & write an attractive headline
2. Create & publish content regularly
3. Engage with other people’s posts
4. Message people in your field, whom you’re inspired by
5. Converse with your network; don’t keep asking for favours
6. Make the most of what you have.

Focus on the things that matter.
Focus on yourself.

So, how will you make the most of LinkedIn?

“Get In On the Action”

“Watch In One Weekend”

“Bingeworthy US TV Dramas”

"Comment “💪🏻” if you’re staying at home!

Over the past few weeks, I’d been hoping to be back home in Mumbai, with my family.

But these past few days, I’ve been wishing my family to be here with me. I’m more worried for them.

I do hope things get okay soon.

And I hope YOU take this seriously, and do YOUR bit to save the people around YOU.

It’s SO EASY.

✖️ You don’t have to be like Mulan and cut off your hair, dress up like a man, and go fight the evil with a sword.

✖️ You don’t have to be like Merida, and restlessly search for a magic potion to reverse some dark curse.

✖️ You don’t have to be like Iron Man and go risk your life against supervillains (well, maybe wearing his suit would be cool..?)

My point is... you don’t have to change yourself and fight big battles to save the world.

It’s simple: stay at home.

Just stay at home.
As long as you can, stay at home.
Even if you can’t, stay at home.

Protect your family, and in a way, also protect mine.

Please, stay at home?

"I’d spent INR 4,800 on contact lenses...

I didn’t like my specs, so I started wearing contact lenses.

But I found contact lenses uncomfortable for daily use. So I would wear them only during outings or to parties.

When I brought these new lenses home, my dad said:

“Why wear lenses only for outings? You should not change yourself for certain occasions or certain people.

Be 100% comfortable in specs, or 100% comfortable in lenses. Always be comfortable with yourself.”

The next day, I returned the lenses.

I completely stopped wearing lenses.

I wore specs for the next 18 months (got a laser surgery few months ago.)

Although this seems simple, it was a very important lesson for me.

Over time, wearing only specs gave me a sense of comfort and confidence.

It all became less stressful — I didn’t have to think whether I wanted to wear lenses or specs— there was no option!

And that’s how big lessons hide in small situations.

I’m thankful to my dad for showing me how to learn from them.

Thanks dad!
And happy birthday!

"I was a poet before I became a content writer.

I have written 400+ poems.

This World Poetry Day, I thought I’d share one with you, written by 13-year-old me.

23rd December, 2012

“Competition”

Competition is a way of life
It is not an alternative to fight
It is a way of being true to learning
It isn't gained without losing something.

Competition - a way to prove oneself better
Something upon which living matters
It can make a friend one's worst enemy
It can fill a person with loads of jealousy.

Competition - persuades to fill oneself with knowledge
It's not as easy as making porridge
Once you have won, no one will forget you
They'll make sure they're the next ones to compete you.

There are a few things, from competition, that I have learnt
That winning is not at all easy to earn
Losing does not matter at all
But if you win, you've won it all.

Losing won't make you less of a (wo)man
But winning will make you a part of master plans.
Competitions make you feel great and true
It makes your intelligence feel brand new.

"I won a summer internship with KPMG Ireland!!!

I won this internship through the Employability Award in Trinity College Dublin.

The Employability Award had 3 levels over 6 months; each with individual assessments:

Level 1:

- Shared reference of completing 320 hours of part-time work
- Attended Career Readiness workshops in Trinity
- Attended workshops at KPMG and PwC

Level 2:
- Attended a CV review session with KPMG
- Submitted “reflective careers assessment”— an essay about my professional development

Level 3:
- Submitted a presentation to KPMG, recommending online marketing solutions for their client
- Shortlisted as 1 of 5 finalists for a 10-minute pitch at KPMG
- Won the pitch... bringing me a summer internship and €500!

I am so excited about this!

Honestly, this year, I hadn’t applied to a single internship. I was ready to take summer as it comes.

And now, I have won an internship with one of the Big 4s, KPMG!

Things work out in mysterious ways, don’t they?

This means, many freelancers are losing work.

These freelancers manage their expenses by taking up regular, limited projects. They only get paid when they work.

"My response to a mean comment shocked the person!

Yesterday, someone left an ‘unkind’ comment on my LinkedIn post.

I responded with kindness and a hint of self-deprecation.

Later, this person messaged me on Facebook.

“You handled it well to say the least. I'm sorry I wrote that...”

Followed by:

“What was your line of thought? I thought you'd just delete the comment, ignore it or write back worse.”

Lessons?

1. People are bitter because they are going through bad things, and no one responds to them or helps them

2. Kindness and acknowledgement kill the bitterness

3. Kindness is a skill too; keep working on it.

And that’s how I deal with ‘unkind’ comments: with empathy and compassion.

How do you deal with ‘unkind’ comments?

"Newton discovered gravity while working from home during the 1665 Plague.

Now, my college has shut down, and we are instructed by authorities to isolate ourselves.

Though I may not be able to beat Newton, here are my goals for the next few weeks:

1. Write more + work more
2. Catch up with studies
3. Complete my essays in time
4. Read the books I’d bought months ago
5. Workout indoors
6. Eat healthy food and not skip meals
7. Sleep enough
8. Watch some movies
9. Learn digital drawing on my iPad
10. Be socially responsible by not stepping out of my house.

"How would you rebuild your ship in the middle of the sea?

Imagine this:

You’re on a wooden ship, in the middle of the sea.

Suddenly, you are required to rebuild the ship.

How would you do that?

You cannot start from the bottom, of course.

So you pull out a beam and instantly replace it with another beam.

You do this, while using the rest of the ship as a support system.

And you keep doing this, step-by-step, until you have rebuilt the entire ship.

This is how philosopher Otto Neurath describes our belief system.

We can change our beliefs bit by bit, and keep replacing them with new beliefs.

Slowly, our entire system is rebuilt. And we have a new belief system.

Why is this important for business?

Because when you persuade your client to close a deal, you shouldn’t give them a heap of reasons to believe in you.

Instead, focus your message, and give them the main reasons why YOU are the right person for the work.

Change their belief in you... one step at a time.

"A bad typist sold a company to Gillette for $47.5mn...

Circa: 1950s.

A typist was introduced to a new kind of typewriter.

Using an eraser on typos of such typewriters would smear the carbon ink.

So, the typist started covering the typos with some blended WHITE PAINT.

After improving upon this white paint, “The Mistake Out Company” was born, and later became the “Liquid Paper Company.”

The business boomed, and this company that began in a kitchen, became a multimillion dollar company.

By 1975, Liquid Paper produced 25 MILLION bottles a year.

The inventor got married, divorced and lost the control of the company to the ex-spouse.

In the 1970s, the inventor fought against the odds and took back ownership of the company.

Soon, the inventor sold the company to Gillette for $47.5 mn (worth $160 mn now)

The inventor’s name? Bette N Graham

She is an inspiring example of grit, ambition & resourcefulness.

Oh, today, Liquid Paper is owned by the $16 BILLION Newell Group!

There are many such stories out there. This women’s day, let’s celebrate these untold stories.

Happy Women’s Day!

Selling.

Selling yourself
Selling your ideas

Selling your curiosity
Selling your charisma

Selling your desires, aims & goals
Selling your dreams & vision
Selling your communication skills
Selling your willingness to learn
Selling your presentation skills

"4 years ago, I started writing content for blogs, social media and websites.

I enjoyed it so much and was so good at it that I thought I would do this for my lifetime.

Then, 2 years ago, I started college, which let me to explore many more possibilities.

And in the last 2 months, I did so much more than writing content.

I brought my startup idea to life, pitched it 6 times in a month, and won funding for it.

I presented at KPMG, sharing my recommendations for one of their clients.

I thought I had a flair only for writing content, but the last few months have said something else.

I am enjoying being a writer, presenter, marketer, communicator, public speaker... the list is getting long.

The truth is: we can never know what we are good at.

As a student, it’s best to seek out and explore all opportunities. It’s best to be multi-skilled.

More importantly, it allows scope for failure, and time to overcome that failure and make things work.

And when things do work out, they could be beyond our wildest imaginations.

We wouldn’t know anything without trying.

What did you not know you were good at until you tried it?

"STOP glorifying failure!

Yes, people fail most of the times.

Failure is a part of your journey to success.

Failure is normal.

BUT

Glorifying failure is NOT okay.

It’s not okay to share your failures and console yourself by saying:

“I failed, but am proud to have reached so far…”
“I failed, but I learnt…”
“It’s okay to fail…”

It's not okay because:

1. Glorifying your failure makes you comfortable with failing
- Accepting failure is good, but being okay with it is not.

2. Glorifying your failure makes you defensive
- Yes, not everything can be controlled; but not everything is out of your control either.

3. Glorifying your failure makes you feel accomplished without winning
- If you are proud of your failures, why would you want to chase success?

So, accept your failures. Be proud of your successes.

And stop glorifying failure.

How do you deal with failure? Comment!

#ShreyaWrites

P.S.
Let’s not glorify failure. Accept a defeat as it is: a defeat. 
Don’t try to transform it in “experience”. It may be an experience IF you swallow your ego and say to yourself: “I lost” 
If you want to be successful, you must respect one rule – never lie to yourself.

"My client made me so uncomfortable that I refunded the advance payment...

A few days ago, I had a new client.

We discussed the details of the work, and the client promptly made the payment.

I indicated that it would take 3-4 days to receive the international payment.

Yet the client kept calling me repeatedly, asking if I had received the money.

The client called me three times when I was on another call, even when I hung up the call.

Received calls twice when I was in a lecture, and the client would have kept calling if I wouldn’t have texted that I was in a lecture.

This was a big red flag.

I just did not want to work with this client anymore.

Within the next 2-3 days, he waved more red flags, ones that I couldn’t ignore.

Eventually, I refused to work for the client and refunded the advance payment.

What would you have done?

"Would you lie to win a competition?

Last week at the Dragons’ Den Finals, one of the judges asked me, “Is your teammate your co-founder?”

I thought for a second, and replied honestly, “No, him and his team will develop the product. I am the Founder of my startup.”

Even after the event, I kept thinking about the purpose of the question.

The next day, I met that judge at another event.

We spoke about my pitch, and he gave me some feedback on it.

That’s when he mentioned that the team was a huge defining factor when it came to the winners.

He said he wanted to know what kind of support and expertise I had in my team; not whose idea it was.

“What if I had said ‘yes, he’s a Co-Founder,’ would I have won?”, I asked him curiously.

“I don’t think so. I think your honesty mattered here, because we already had an idea that he was NOT a Co-Founder based on your pitch. Saying yes wouldn’t have changed things…”

That was true.

My pitch was crystal clear about my team; changing it would not have made much of a difference.

What do you think?

Would you lie in a competition, if it would help you win?

Comment your answer!

"My 3-step method to practising an award-winning business pitch ;)

1. Recorded the audio 🎙

- Once my slide deck was ready, I recorded an “informal” audio of me presenting. This gave me an idea of the time, allowed me to revisit my “unexpected” punchlines, and also helped me edit the slide deck instantly.

2. Practised the actual pitch 👩🏻‍💻

- After finalising my slide deck based on step-1, I stood up and practised the pitch. I always timed myself so I didn’t exceed the 5-minute mark. I knew there would be a timer at the event, so I made sure to hit a certain slide by the 30-second countdown.

3. Walked around in heels 👠

- As odd as this may seem, wearing heels during the practise made a huge difference. I don’t normally wear heels, so this really helped develop the feel and comfort of heels. Oh, and I also held a hairbrush as a mic 🎤!

How do you practise for a business pitch?

"I won “Best Presenter” at a Hackathon and 2 RyanAir tickets as a prize!

Last Friday, I attended a day-long hackathon hosted by Tangent, Trinity's Ideas Workspace, Dublin Airport DUB & Trinity Business School.

Starting at 9am, we engaged with fellow students, mentors & Dublin Airport employees, hacking the challenges faced by the Dublin Airport.

After 2 hours of intense discussions, we pitched our ideas in 30secs, hoping to form the best team.

Soon, we got together in teams of 4 and discussed solutions for real airport challenges.

My team and I explored options to increase the click-rate and revenue for Dublin Airport’s e-commerce platform.

We brainstormed for hours & hours, modified our ideas, prepared our pitch deck, and finally pitched to our judges.

It’s amazing how many ideas all the teams could come up in 8 hours!

The night ended with a lovely dinner, and an unexpected announcement for the “Best Presenter” (eep!)

So grateful for this amazing day, and congratulations to Alison and David for pulling this off so successfully!

Excited for the Provost’s hackathon!

"“Don’t forget Valentine’s Day”

I went grocery shopping at Lidl yesterday.

At the checkout counter, I saw this sign.

This sign showcased a very powerful marketing move:

1. The copy was a crisp reminder for Valentine’s Day [hooked the emotion]

2. It encouraged customers to buy gifts at Lidl and save money [helped make a logical decision]

3. There were bouquets near the sign, which were accessible gift options [instant CTA]

4. The sign was strategically placed at the checkout counter [cannot be missed]

5. It was cost-efficient to place the sign at the checkout counter, and not throughout the store [natural sight; non- invasive or forceful]

This sign is a reminder that you don’t need fancy words and big budgets to market well.

Keep the copy simple, and market the ad where relevant.

What do you think about this sign?

He added that I could tweet @dublinbusnews for help, and that’s exactly what I did.

And now, at 1pm, I have my Leap Card back with me!

"Should you get paid less for your own byline?

This was an interesting discussion in the comment box of a post.

Someone said, “You may choose to have your own byline, but the client may pay less for it...”

I think that’s the wrong way to look at it.

YOU wrote the article.
It’s your content.
You must get credit for your content.
So, your byline is your obvious right.

But if a client wants to put their own byline instead of yours, they are taking credit for YOUR writing.

Which means: you get to charge the same fee, or more, for not only writing the article, but also giving away the credits.

So, if you have been getting paid less by clients for getting your byline, rethink your deals.

How do you charge for your byline?

"“I’m building a business and I want to beat THAT company...”

I often get such messages from fresh entrepreneurs.

They contact me for content.

When I ask what the purpose of their content is, they say, “I want to beat XYZ.”

I think that’s where most people lose their focus.

The purpose of your marketing should be to:
1. Listen to and understand your audience
2. Grab attention
3. Get more leads
4. Get and retain clients
5. Grow your business and be profitable.

If you are focused on beating a well-established business that are market leaders, rather than growing and building your own business, you are letting yourself down.

It doesn’t matter who else is in the game.

All that matters is that you play YOUR part and focus on doing what is required for your business.

If you want to compare your startup company to a competitor, compare yourself to their nascent and startup stage.

You‘ll be truly surprised to see the number of pivots they did to reach the present stage!

Your business is about you and your customers.
These are your priorities.
Not the competition.

So, what’s your purpose of building a business?

"Freelancers are jugglers.

We juggle multiple tasks singlehandedly.

I often hear freelancers talk about the challenges in prospecting, client engagement, pricing, payments and more.

Yet one thing that is rarely talked about is the use of multiple apps repeatedly in our workflow.

Every day, I use so many apps and platforms to get my work done:

WhatsApp
Email
LinkedIn
Instagram
Calendly
Google Docs
Google Sheet
PayPal
…

I end up juggling 10 tabs on my laptop, making it challenging to focus on one task.

This reduces my work efficiency a lot.

This also takes up a lot of my time that I could have spent in completing the work and meeting my deadlines.

So yes, freelancing is not only challenging, it’s also disorganised.

And I know many of you are facing these problems too...

So I have created a survey to understand the challenges faced by freelancers.

I request you to fill it in and help me dig deep into the challenges of the freelancing community.

The link is in comments.

Please comment “Done” when you’ve filled the form.

I‘ll be picking one lucky freelancer for a FREE 20-min content consultation call with me!

Thank you so much for your time!

"“People should stop posting their success on LinkedIn... it discourages others”

I’ve read many such posts on LinkedIn recently.

My question is: WHY?

Why should one NOT share their success?

We don’t know what the person has gone through to achieve that success.

We don’t know what demons they’ve fought in their personal darkness to achieve that success.

Anyone who has achieved something DESERVES to share their success with the world.

If you resent other people’s success, that’s on you.

Let’s seek motivation in others wins and not be judgemental.

Let’s not label it as a “show off” and deride the success stories.

You are truly successful only when the success of others causes you no discomfort.

So, instead of telling people to stop sharing their successes, join them in their celebrations.

After all, if we don’t applaud others, why will anyone ever applaud us?

P.S. Celebrate what you’ve accomplished, but raise the bar a little higher each time you succeed.

"“Shreya, the social media posts got us followers, but no clients…”

99% businesses think that’s all there is to marketing!

They think these will get them customers:
- social media accounts and publishing blogs
- high number of followers
- post promotions and more “likes.”

That’s not the complete answer.

Marketing is NOT only social media, emails and blog posts.

Marketing is building relationships.
Making connections.
Being empathetic.

First, you need to ACTUALLY market. The traditional way.

Understand your customer base.
Understand their pain points.
Build and test your solution.
Get your company out there.
Network.
Sell with your words.
Try, fail, retry.
Grind! Grind! Grind!

Yes, social media ‘helps’ build a brand.

Social media helps create a buzz, and complements your efforts.

But... social media is a marketing enhancing tool, not an effort replacement tool.

If you want to sell, you have to get out there and put in the ACTUAL work!

How are you marketing your business?

"My client designed my website!

A few months ago, a prospect approached me for social media marketing.

We spoke, and soon I started writing for him.

After a few weeks, he told me about his new venture of website development.

He asked me if I knew anyone who’s looking for a website...

I said, “Me!”

In a few days, I prepared the content, sent it over, and his team started building the website.

This team was Amoga Web Labs.

They were very efficient with feedback and updates, and are working towards my dream website!

It’s wonderful to know that you can be your client’s client! It’s a win-win for both!

I’m so excited to show you all the final cut!

Quick questions:
What would you like to see on my website?
What would you like my website to do?

"Dear prospects,

Please don’t set whimsical shortlisting and selection criteria. Our time matters too...

A prospect approached me.

We spoke over the phone, he asked me some questions about my work.

I mentioned clearly that the domain they operate in is new to me.

The prospect said that was okay, and gave me a writing assignment for trial and to test my capability.

The assignment involved intense research.

Since the domain was new to me, I ventured to write with dedication, spending hours on getting it right.

Once I submitted the assignment, the client said that they found my work impressive, but they were looking for writers with specific expertise and experience in their domain.

Since I lacked the experience, I was not even a part of their selection criteria.

This was disheartening.

This seems to be even worse than nepotism.

If you are looking to hire someone, be a clear and transparent about the shortlisting and selection criteria.

Most importantly, abide by this criteria.

Our time is valuable too.

"Freelancing life can get very demanding.

Every morning, I look at my to-do list.

Then I tell myself, “Let me get these things done this week, and then I’ll take a day off and also focus on studies...”

And I end up saying the same thing to myself every single day.

Prospects
Clients
Writing
Researching
Messages
Emails
Submission
Updates
Feedback
Edits
Follow ups...

The list doesn’t end, and neither does the process!

The time for a “break” never comes!

Yes, I love writing.

I love writing so much that I don’t want to stop!

As good as that passion is, it also brings its own challenges.

So, after months and months of daily hustle, it’s time for course correction!

I won’t be working on Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays.
(I have long Mondays in college)

No work messages or emails.
No calls or meetings.
No work.

I aim to study, rest, and recharge during these 3 days.

I will be working Tuesdays to Fridays.

Looking forward to making my life much more creative and efficient.

"“How long did it take for you to buy your iPad?”

Pranav S Nair asked me this on my recent post.

It took me 15 months.

These 15 months involved:

1. Content writing/ copywriting for my clients
2. Prospecting
3. Writing and updating posts on LinkedIn
4. Attending college lectures
5. Studying for college
6. Completing college assignments
7. Taking 3 months off for exams
8. Taking up various roles in college
9. Managing and attending college events
10. Cooking my own meals everyday
11. Cleaning my own room...

There was so MUCH to do.

Being so occupied with college and household chores gave me very little time to actually work and write.

This made me realise the importance of generating maximum value from the limited time available.

This made me:
- push myself harder
- make the most of every minute I had
- look at the bigger picture
- grab bigger opportunities
- lucky.

After all the hustle, 15 months in, I bought the iPad.

Oh, and I bought it with one invoice :)

(While also paying my monthly expenses for 15 months!)

Limited time makes you focused. Harness the power of time that’s available to you.

"What would you choose for YOUR LinkedIn posts?

1. More followers?
2. More comments?
3. More views?
4. More likes?

I would choose the secret option:
5. More leads and more deals.

Yes!

Likes, comments, views and followers have their relative importance.

But the ultimate metric is ‘conversion’.

Even people who don’t ‘like’ or ‘comment’ on my posts invariably reach out through DM (and are the best prospects!)

At the end of the day, what matters to me is:
1. How many leads hit my inbox
2. How many deals I close
3. How many deals I turn into long-term ones.

What ‘numbers’ matter to you?

"“But content writing can’t make you enough money…”

Well, my writing paid for my iPad Pro.

Time and again I’ve heard this:

“Writing is not a stable career…”
“Freelancing doesn’t work, a job is must…”

Here’s what I have to say to that:

I just bought an iPad Pro.

It has always been my dream to buy an Apple product by myself.

I used to think that the iPhone 20 would be out by the time I could buy one...

But no! I did it!

I bought an iPad, and we are still years away from iPhone 20!

I did this by:

- Committing to writing
- Grabbing every opportunity that flashed by me
- Working intensely hard everyday
- Being patient

And of course, with a big slice of luck (the slice gets bigger with hard work and patience.)

I fulfilled my dream while walking the “unconventional” path of writing.

I bought an “aspirational” product by chasing what I wanted.

And it is such a special feeling to buy something you really wanted, especially by doing what you love so much.

So, if you want to do something, do it.

Give your goals a chance.
Give yourself a chance.

Do it for yourself. Results will come.

So, what’s an aspirational product you aim to buy?

"The maintenance man told me to use egg and milk in my hair... WHAT???

I live in a student hostel.

Every 3-4 weeks, the drain in my bathroom gets clogged.

I clean it as much as I can, but there’s always something inside that chokes the drain.

Then, I request the maintenance officer to help me clean it.

Each time he checks it and finds entangled hair, he says, “You should apply egg and milk to your hair to reduce hair fall...”

The first time he said that, I was taken aback.

Now I just start laughing inside.

Because now I realise: he’s trying to solve my problem from the root (pun intended.)

Yes, he’s helping me with a solution to my problem

AND

He’s showing me how to avoid the problem in the first place!

That’s something to learn from and be thankful for.

Be it unclogging the drain, shopping, commuting, closing deals... take an extra step to help others out.

Do beyond what others ask you for.

You will be remembered very fondly for it.

And you will feel nice too!

Be compassionate.
Be empathetic.
Be thankful.

So, what extra steps will you take to help others?

"Can you win a French scrabble competition?

You:
- don’t know French?
- don’t speak French?
- don’t understand French?

Yes, you CAN still WIN.

In July 2015, Nigel Richards of New Zealand participated in the French World Scrabble Championship.

He didn’t know French.

Yet he won!

How?

He memorised all the words in the French Scrabble dictionary!

3,86,000 words!!!

And he did this in less than 3 months!

Oh— and he won it again in 2018.

Check:

Though he had won various English scrabble competitions, he was hungry for winning more.

It’s a feat!

His win shows that ‘good obsessions’ can win you anything you want in life.

His championship win shows that success is a matter of commitment and putting in the necessary grind.

Be obsessive.
Be committed.
Keep winning.

What is your obsession?

"What do copywriters really do???

Chava Shapiro asked in her recent post:

“It's a little embarrassing that I make a living out of helping businesses articulate what they do, and yet people often seem confused when I try to explain what I do.

In all seriousness, where am I going wrong? Why does it seem difficult for people to understand what a copywriter does? Help!? “

Here’s my response:

This used to happen to me a lot. When I told people I was a writer, they asked what news article I wrote recently. When I told them I was a copywriter, they assumed I copy and write. Hmm.

Now, I just tell them things like this:

🍷 The delicious description of the wine that makes you grab that bottle? That’s me.

📷 That caption you took a screenshot of? That’s me.

📕 That description you read at the back of your book? That’s me.

📩 Those annoying newsletters you get, that you just can’t stop reading? That’s me.

💰 That ad that makes you want to spend more $$$ to save some $? That’s me.

📺 That Netflix show description that makes you want to watch it? That’s me.

This helps people realise that EVERYTHING IS CONTENT!

"How to conquer stress!

I used to buy my groceries for the whole week.

Three different fruits, lots of veggies, yoghurt, milk…

Since individual pieces of fruits and veggies are expensive, I normally buy packets of 4-5.

I planned to cook and eat all the food during the week.

But I couldn’t always do that.

So, by the weekend most of my food would go bad.

This caused me immense stress.

I hate wasting food.
I hate wasting money.

I tried storing food in proper containers, keeping them in the fridge, keeping them on the table so I would remember to eat them… nothing helped.

Finally, I did two things:

1. Started grocery shopping 2-3 times a week and buying the minimal quantities
2. Got my fridge checked (turned out there was a problem.)

Yes, some things that cause stress are out of my control.

But, some things are in my control.

So why should I stress over problems that CAN be solved?

Yes, it takes effort to go to the shop 2-3 times a week.

But, it also brings me peace of mind!

With time I have realised that my mental peace is paramount.

And mental peace requires extra work!

"Muskan Bansal asked 3 questions in her recent post:

1. Can a BCom graduate earn enough to save for a Post Graduation in 2 years?

2. What's the scope for content writing in long term?

3. If I start saving today, what's the best way to do that?

Kindly help her out by commenting your answers.

My answers:

1. It depends on how much a BCom graduate can earn and SAVE in 2 years, and the cost of PG. Outliers should not be considered as norms, so decide wisely.

More importantly the reason for pursuing PG should make economic and logical sense. Generally PG is a requirement and valued more in academics and research. These are my observations only, I may be wrong about these aspects.

2. Skills rarely become obsolete; though they may ‘transform’ due to prevailing tech and market demands. If content writing is considered as a skill, then it will last as long as ‘content’ is in demand, which in my opinion is forever.

3. It’s a personal choice and difficult to say. Savings can get you only so far; focusing on increasing the income is much more important.

The best way to make a living is doing what you love. The ROI in this is always positive and extremely high! :)

"Are you making this mistake on LinkedIn?

A few days ago, I saw an error in a LinkedIn post.

I sent this DM to the writer:

“Hey, I’ve been reading your recent posts, they are good! Just one suggestion: don’t use ‘shall.’ Write ‘I will’, or ‘I am.’

‘Shall’ is an awkward word to use in most instances, so avoid it almost everywhere. Hope this helps :)”

His response?
“That’s a great observation Shreya! Thanks for pointing it out. I’m happy you like my content :)”

This is my personal rule:
Never share the error as a public comment. Instead, DM the writer.

Why?

Because:

- LinkedIn posts take a lot of time and effort to create
- Errors are a natural part of the writing process
- Most of us are exposing our vulnerable aspect in writing.

A LinkedIn post is beyond its errors.

And writers are beyond their writing flaws.

Remember: kindness towards each other’s creativity will make the world creative and kind.

So, don’t make the mistake of not being kind on LinkedIn.

Oh, and if someone does comment about an error: thank them for it.

How would you prefer to know about your writing errors?

"Why this Kolaveri Di?

Remember this song with its quirky lyrics, peppy tunes and raw voice?

The lyrics were a fusion of Tamil and English words strung together in ways that made no sense.

Yet, the song became a global sensation, being played in Turkey and Hong Kong!

Okay, why does this matter?

It proves that songs or lyrics don’t have to make ‘sense’ or be ‘understood’!

They just need to communicate the message clearly and touch the individuals.

So... you don’t have to be grammatically correct always.

Don’t stop expressing yourself just because you think your grammar is not good or you may make mistakes.

Especially if English is not your first language, grammar mistakes are okay as long as they do not distract the reader.

Almost all the best selling classics have typos too!

Focus on honing your art and improving your creativity.

There are many people out there with good grammar, but very few people who can write well.

Just create!

"This one message will save you hours (and make you money!)

Imagine this:

A prospect approaches you.
You set up a call.
You speak for 30 mins.
You send a proposal.
You get the response, “Your price is too high, sorry.”

You spent hours on a prospect, only to hear a no.

This is the number 1 barrier in turning a prospect into a client: budget.

So, tackle this problem at its roots; qualify your prospect at the outset!

Suppose a prospect messages you about website content.

Before setting up a call, write to them:

“Out of respect for your time and mine, I would like to inform you that my fee for website content starts from €300. Does this suit you?”

If they say no, move on to the next prospect.

If they say yes, set up a call. Now both of you know the minimum fee to expect.

Try this process the next time a prospect approaches you.

You’ll not only save time, but make money too :)

She just sends me captions, asks me to check the grammar, and thanks me for my response.

She has been doing this for 5 months now.

She messaged me again today.

I finally asked her why she asks me for sentence correction.

After all, I don’t know her, and I don’t think she really knows I’m a writer.

She replied, “I came through your profile accidentally and saw that your English is very good. And also you are very helping and warm. So I contact you whenever I am confused.”

If you write well, people don’t need to know you as a writer. People will know you for your writing.

"Planning for 2020?

Nah...

Plan for 2030!

No, I don't mean that you should plan what you want to do 10 years from now.

I mean that your goals for 2020 should become your habits: something you stick to forever.

Your goals for 2020 should lead you to a better version of you in 2030.

Be it:
Physical health
Mental health
Emotional intelligence
Skill development
Making money
Enriching relationships
Starting your venture
Showcasing your creativity...

Whatever your goals are for this year, make them sustainable and compoundable. Chase these goals for the coming years.

If you achieve a goal in 2020, move on to the next step of this goal.

Look at the long term gain.

Be patient!

Own the process!

What are your goals for 2030?

"What a wonderful start to my new year!

I received this message on Instagram yesterday.

I love knowing that my writing is...

— initiating people into writing

— helping people take up content writing

— expanding the community of writers.

Such messages reinforce my belief that writing is a very powerful medium... writing is not only about the 'call to action', it's about expressing oneself for eternity.

I look forward to more words in this new year!

"Would you run an online casino to fund your education?

I met a girl some time back.

We got chatting and I found out that she was a student.

We spoke about moving abroad, the expenses, and part-time jobs.

She replied off-handedly:
“I run my own online casino to pay my fees.”

What???

This was the most unbelievable part-time job I’d ever heard from a student.

Running a casino?
To pay college fees?
WOW!

"This is my favourite message.

My baby sister is 12 years old.

Every month, I order her a few books from Amazon.

As soon as she receives the book, she sends me a picture of it.

Once she’s done reading, she texts me: “I finished the book 😁”

This week, I sent her “The Night Diary” by Veera Hiranandani.

The historical fiction set in 1947 is the story of a 12-year-old girl’s “search for home, for her own identity…and for a hopeful future.”

This book is unlike any I have ever sent to my sister. I wasn’t sure if she would find it interesting.

To my surprise, my mom said that my sister sat with the book all evening and finished it in one go.

My sister then sent me this message.

It made me so happy!

I love it when she reads a book I’ve sent her.

And I love it even more when she finishes reading the book within 4 hours!

It’s the simple things in life that can keep both siblings happy... like sending books and reading them :)

"In 2017, I applied to 11 premier universities for my Bachelors.

I got into 10.

For any university application, the following 3 things are critical:
1. Application form
2. Letter of recommendation (LOR)
3. Statement of purpose (SOP)

The application forms were straightforward.

Letters of recommendation were given to me by my teachers and employers.

The ‘make it or break it’ feature was my Statement of Purpose.

A good SOP is one which:
1. Tells your story
2. Exhibits your personality
3. Narrates your achievements (and lessons)
4. Shares your future goals.

Basically, a Statement of Purpose tells the, well, purpose of your life.

Again, a good SOP is also:
1. Succinct
2. Cohesive
3. Persuasive
4. Emotional.

Keep these things in mind, and begin writing!

Remember: A good SOP takes days, weeks, months to write (and rewrite.) Give it the time it deserves.

"3 lessons I learnt in 2019:

1. Showing up matters

I showed up everywhere: personally and virtually. I attended many college events, and networked with my professors and event guests. I shared my work with everyone, and most of them asked me to write for them!

2. I am not entitled to success just because I work hard

I attended 10am lectures, did my household chores, and worked until 4am to hit the deadlines. This gave me the false impression that I am ‘entitled’ to faster results.

Once I realised that I am not entitled to anything just because I am working hard on something I CHOSE to do, I started accepting life as it happens.

3. Not everything requires an immediate response

When I started freelancing, I was keen on providing the best and prompt service. Responding instantly made me miss the opportunities to think through and respond in a nuanced manner.

It took one ‘tough’ client to set up my work boundaries. I then limited myself from responding instantly and started using the ‘archive’ option!

What did you learn this year?

"I’m back to content writing after a week.

I took a break to prepare my exams.

During this break, when I was befriending Nietzsche and Shakespeare, my thoughts would go back to my content writing.

While studying my coursework, an idea would pop in my head:

‘Oh I could try this strategy with this client...’

‘What about this theme for January?’

‘This is what we need to change!’

I would jot these ideas down in my diary.

These random thoughts didn’t need an effort; just a pause from work.

The break didn’t distract me from my work. My mind kept me thinking about improving my writing.

And no doubt, this break was made easier by my clients.

A huge shoutout to all my clients for being supportive about the week’s break and wishing me luck for my exams!

Well, my exams are done, Semester 1 is now complete, and Christmas vacations are here!

I look forward to writing blogs and social media posts on ten different topics, and not just essays on Nietzsche and Shakespeare!

"I wrote my first article of 450 words for €70 (₹5,600).

That’s how I began in the writing world.

The thing is: my first project wasn’t underpaid.

My first project wasn’t vague or tedious.

My first project did not need multiple follow-ups for payment.

In fact, my first project was straightforward.

The prospect messaged me.
He told me exactly what he wanted.
He told me the fee.
He told me the deadline.
He asked if I was interested.

I said yes.

I wrote the article and submitted it.

The client requested some edits.

I edited the article and sent it back to him.

He approved it.

My PayPal instantly pinged with “You’ve got money!”

That’s it!

My first project was a good one.

It did one important thing for me: I discovered my starting fee.

I knew what I’d begun with.
And I knew I had to charge at least this much for any new projects.

And that’s how I defined my price and value.

Indeed, my first project lit up my freelancing career.

"How my Monday went:-

#Scene 1:

Last night, 12:30am.
I uploaded all the visa documents I needed, onto my student print account. The idea was to save time in the morning: just go to college and use the card to print.

Today, 8:30am.
Reached college. Left my student card (and 30 mins of late night effort) at home.

Thought I’d saved time. No :(

(Psst: a friend helped me with the prints)

#Scene 2:

Waited for 2 hours at the visa office today morning.

Solved 2 Philosophy past papers while waiting. Exams start on Wednesday.

Thought I’d lost time. No :)

"Aparna asked me: how to handle harsh/ rude clients?

My dad taught me 3 life-saving methods:

1. Take everything seriously but don’t take anything personally.

Getting angry and wanting to lash out is the natural response when provoked. Though the feelings may not be in your control, avoid reacting on basis of feelings.
Focus on the message; not on the tone or choice of words.

2. Consider cutting them off.

Complete their work soon, and don't take up more work from them. Your mental peace >>> bickering everyday.

3. Charge ‘obscene’ amounts for new projects.

Making good money is a satisfying way to handle harsh clients ;)

Freelancing may bring you many rude texts, emails and calls.

If you react to them, they ""win"".

Don't react.
Don’t lose control.
Don’t lose yourself.

"This was the 7th time someone stopped me in the last 2 months...

Two days ago, I was walking towards the printer in the Business School.

I was counting the number of pages in my head, when someone stopped me and asked, ""Hey is your name...""

I stood there, barely blinking my eyes.

""Sorry I am not sure how to pronounce your name but I see your posts on LinkedIn... is that you?""

I smiled and said yes, and introduced myself to this PG student.

This has happened so many times in this one semester. People stop me everywhere and ask me if am the ""LinkedIn Girl"", and I love it!

"The art of engaging as a brand...

A brand gets different responses/ comments:

1. Appreciative
2. Provocative and abusive
3. Critical/feedback-oriented.

How to respond in each case:

1. Thank them for their appreciation.

2. Engage only if you can leave an empathetic imprint. Else avoid.

3. For critical/feedback-oriented comments, follow these steps:

— i. Begin with empathy:
""We are sorry you had to face this issue, [name].""

— ii. Provide your solution:
""Please drop us an email at xxx and we will look into this issue.""

— iii. Offer to help:
""If you have any questions/concerns, please message us and we'll help you out.""

— iv. Be grateful:
""Thanks for choosing us!""

#Eg., if my brand SNB sold a notebook and got a comment from Pooja that the pages were stained, I would respond:

""We are sorry you had to face this issue, Pooja. Please raise a complaint at SNBdotcom and our team will help you with the best solution. If you have any other concerns, please write to us. Thanks for choosing SNB!""

As a brand, be humane.
Be empathetic.

How you make people FEEL is what sticks with your brand.

"Hardik Lashkari asked an important question about social media presence.

""In a never ending world of social media platforms, how should a writer maintain his or her presence across these platforms?

The moment you disappear from one platform, your engagement thrashes down.""

#Answer:

There are many social media platforms available.
[LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, Quora, Medium, etc]

The best part? Most social media platforms are free to use.

They are free in terms of money.

BUT they require a crucial investment: YOUR TIME.

So, understand this:

You don't need to maintain your presence across ALL platforms.

Experiment with platforms...

... stick to those which MAKE YOU MONEY.

Invest time where you get returns.

Work on the rewarding platforms.

Then, save even more time by repurposing content.

Followed these steps?
Congratulations, you are now present where you SHOULD be.

"I NEVER charge per word.

[Reposting this since pricing services is a dilemma!]

Quoting a price is much more than finance. It is all about the human psyche. It's about understanding how the mind perceives information.

Suppose I quote ""INR 8 per word for a 400-word blog*"".

Here's what happens:

1. This statement starts a tedious process of calculation in the reader's mind

2. The reader starts multiplying 400 with 8, and starts worrying about the number of digits in the end result

3. It makes the reader compare my charge to the value of one word, than the overall article (1 word= INR 8??? Oh my God!)

4. It creates the perception that I am charging TOO high for content.

BUT...

When I quote ""INR 3,200 for a 400-word blog*"", the game changes.

Then:

1. The brain is spared of calculations where 2 small numbers create a much larger one

2. The reader considers the overall amount being paid for the value of a complete article.

A blog is much more than a set of words put together. So why charge per word?

Charge for the #value you provide.

"“We’ll give you bulk work of 60,000 words, promise”

A lady messaged me a few minutes ago.

She wanted 1 blog every day, coming up to 60,000 words every month.

I quoted my fee.

She replied, “We are working with more than 28 writers... for ₹0.5 per word ($0.007)”

“We promise you will get bulk work for a year”

Here’s the thing:

1. Why would I work MORE for less money?

2. Why would I want to slog over 25-30 blogs for ₹30,000 ($400) when I could earn that much with 3-4 blogs?

Enticing with ‘bulk work’ for less money is the wrong strategy.

I would rather work less but get paid what I ask for.

I don’t freak out anymore.

After getting hundreds of different responses each week, I am unbothered by the style of response.

Tone doesn’t matter anymore.

In this simple way, prospects and clients have made me emotionally robust.

Little things make a big difference, don’t they?

"How to make money without spending money...

Don’t meet people.

Yes.
Don’t travel.
Don’t meet people.

The best part of freelancing is that it’s remote.

The best part of living in 2019 is that everything can be remote.

You don’t need to spend time or money to close deals.

Skip the formal dress up. Skip the traffic. Skip the wait.

Do this:

1. Get a basic brief from the prospect on email/text

2. Speak to the prospect over a 30-minute call
- Discuss their requirement
- Answer queries
- Ask doubts

3. Think whether you both are a good fit for each other

4. Send a proposal to the prospect

5. Answer any queries on a follow-up call of 15-30 mins

6. Send a contract, get it approved and signed

7. Set up longer calls if needed to discuss the details of the work.

Here’s what you spend: 1.5 hours.
- 1 hour on 2 calls
- 30 minutes making/ sending the proposal

If you use an app (WhatsApp, Zoom, Skype) for a call, the call itself is practically free.

Drop the travel.

Save your time and money while you earn (save) more.

"Start with a mess!

The feedback I received on my first essay of the semester was:
‘Each new paragraph starts abruptly.’

To improve on this aspect of my essay writing, I met my Trinity professor.

She said, “Make it messy.”

- Start with a draft that is all over the place.

- Throw in quotes, references and ideas randomly.

- Think, think out aloud, and type it out.

- And when you have done it all, make an outline and fit in the essentials.

If you start with a mess,

- you will be more critical of your own work

- you will be willing to move things around until they are in the right place.

But:
If you start with an essay-like flow that looks ‘beautiful’, you won’t want to move things around... because there are no things left to move around!

And this has nothing to do with language or writing skills.

It’s all about craftsmanship.

It’s all about how the writing is perceived.

Perception rules.

"""Shreya, we love your work. Please go through this company profile and edit it. It's just a matter of 10 mins...""

I had just submitted my first blog to a client, when I got this response.

He had paid the advance promptly.

I checked the document of the company profile.

It was 2 pages long in font size 9.

I reviewed the work and quoted my fee.

He responded with many appreciative words, praising my approach and work, only to conclude that he was 'not sold.'

Seems pretty normal right?

Watch out for:

1. Too much praise too soon
- It was just 1 blog!

2. Unwarranted praise
- Flattery, only to ignore/dismiss everything you say/do.

3. Undervaluing work
- ""just a matter of 10 mins"", ""a simple edit"", ""it's not hard"", ""whip something up""... constantly belittling your work.

But, he had made the payment on time... that's all that matters, right?

Wrong!

Soon, he questioned all the work I did.

He brought up issues on things that he had already signed and agreed upon.

Eventually, he broke the contract halfway.

Lesson? Timely payment does not entitle a client to freebies.

Don’t get manipulated by appreciation.

Fake appreciation cannot replace payment.

"Growing up, I watched a lot of superhero movies.

Batman, Superman, Spiderman… these were my favourites. My dad and I would watch these on TV every weekend.

The concept of a hero was ‘simple’:
— Has a superpower
— Is very strong
— Fights bad guys
— Has a weakness
— Overcomes his weakness
— Saves the heroine
— Saves the world.

That’s all it takes.

As I grew up, this concept changed.

I realised that such a hero is not realistic. And not real.

Instead, a real ‘hero’ is one who:

— Has a superpower: empathy & compassion
— Is very strong: enough to help you out
— Fights bad guys: fights the problems you are facing
— Has a weakness: faces his own struggles
— Overcomes his weakness: fights his battles & asks for help
— Saves the heroine: helps whoever he can
— Saves the world: makes the world a better place.

This is so much simpler than the concept we see on TV.

And the best part? THIS IS REAL.

Shoutout to my dad for showing me THIS IS REAL.

Like him, I know some amazing men in my life.

Men who vouched for me in my hardest times.
Men who supported me.
Men who changed my life.

Such men are revolutionary.

If you have such men in your life, you are incredibly lucky.
They will always stand by you.

Happy International Men’s Day!

"I attended a talk by Gurudev Sri Sri Ravi Shankar today in college...

Earlier this evening, I sat in a packed theatre of over 300 people.

Rupert Pennant-Rea interviewed Gurudev Sri Sri Ravi Shankar in this 90-minute event.

Gurudev, as he is respectfully called, especially spoke about the human nature.

He explained how each person wants only to be loved and be understood.

He stressed that one who is angry or upset can easily be dealt with if we are willing to understand them.

To make this world a better place, all that us humans need to be is kind.

It’s that simple.

As always, I am very grateful to Trinity for all the wonderful opportunities.

Grateful today, and everyday.

"I won every poem recitation competition for 4 years... for the same poem!

It all started when I was in the first grade.

I had my first ever poem recitation competition.

As usual, I made my own list of common poems and took it to my dad.

My dad got up, went to the huge 'library' in my room, took out a book of poems and flipped some pages.

He stopped at the page with the poem ""The Tyger"" by William Blake.

He read the poem out to me, stressing on the words that the 6-year-old me would have mispronounced: 'thine', 'sinews', 'dread'.

For a week, I sat with the poem, memorising it stanza by stanza.

On the day of the competition, I took my toy tiger to school and set it on the table next to me while reciting the poem.

I won first place in the whole of first grade.

By this time, I had fallen in love with 'The Tyger' and refused to give it up.

I recited it again and again and again for 3 more years, and won first place each time.

And that's what my childhood was based on: a fearfully symmetrical 'Tyger'.

Happy Children's Day!

"Today I met a guy who backpacked to the frontline fight against ISIS. WHAT?

I met William Meara just a few minutes ago.

He was at Trinity for a ‘TES Talk’.

He has led one of the most fascinating lives anyone could ever live.

I mean, imagine doing this:

— Leaving Engineering just because it’s ‘boring’

— Picking up a backpack and leaving your own world behind for months together

— Travelling across the world, exploring Iraq, Pakistan, Bangladesh, North Korea

— Taking a caravan trip all the way from Bangalore to Ladakh

— Making it to the frontline fight against ISIS

— Finding your calling and starting an Events company that blows up to make millions each year.

Breathtaking right?

Surprise: William has done it all.

He started off his talk about his backpacking adventures.

The more he spoke, the more I was amazed.

How can anyone possibly explore the world this way? Is this real?

Hands down, this was one of the best TES Talks I’ve ever been to.

Those 60 minutes of the talk were an absolute thrill in themselves.

Hope to see you again, William!

"It has been over a year since I moved to a whole different continent for college, and I still clearly remember the daunting experience of deciding to study abroad:

- Researching universities
- Shortlisting universities
- Applying to universities
- Finalising one university
- Applying for the visa
- Finding accommodation... and more.

Those four-five months I spent in figuring all of this out were life-changing for me.

If you are someone who is planning to go abroad for either an undergraduate or postgraduate course, I am sure you have a lot of questions.

And I am sure you will have new questions popping up every minute. Don’t worry, that’s normal!

To help you get some direction, I have compiled a ‘guide’ to all your study abroad queries. The best part? These are based on my personal experiences!

"Positivity is overrated.
Beginning is underrated.

Motivation is overrated.
Repetition is underrated.

Inspiration is overrated.
Consistency is underrated.

A few weeks ago, I started going to the gym.

I planned to work out 3 days a week.

￼Walking down to the gym felt like a huge task.

Yet I forced myself to go.

My college schedule kept changing, so I went whenever I could.

The idea wasn’t to create a routine of going to the gym at a certain time.

The idea was to just keep showing up, until this became a habit. A discipline.

By the end of the third week, going to the gym wasn’t an ‘extra’ task.

I knew that once I was back from college, I had to eat, rest, change, and go work out. Simple.

The fact is: you cannot rely on positivity, motivation and inspiration.

If you really want to do something, you can’t wait for the ‘perfect moment’ to start.

You can’t wait for a ‘push’.

You can’t wait for ‘good feelings’.

You have to just get up and do it.

If I go to the gym only when I am motivated, I will rarely go!

Action > Motivation/ positivity/ inspiration/ etc.

Don’t wait to ‘feel good.’

Focus on building a discipline.
Focus on having a ritual.

"When I discussed Bombay's monsoon with Ireland’s Prime Minister!

I attended the Future Jobs event in college today.

The PM Leo Varadkar addressed the audience.

Soon after, a group of students were invited for a group picture with the PM.

He greeted each student.

He turned to me; I said, “Hi, I’m Shreya.”

He smiled, and was turning towards the camera... when I said, “I am from Bombay.”

He instantly turned towards me and said “Oh I was in Bombay for Christmas!”

He then asked me where in Bombay I was from (turns out his uncle lives pretty close to me.)

We chatted and then smiled for a group picture.

I asked for a personal picture and he happily agreed!

I thought the conversation would end there.

It didn’t!

He stayed and spoke to me.

He asked me how I liked Ireland and what I was studying. We even compared the Irish and Bombay rains!

I also told him about my student-led venture to hack homelessness.

Honestly, the entire conversation was so effortless: like talking to a friend!

Thank you for your kindness, Leo Varadkar!

Thanks Dr. Sonam Prakashini Banka for inviting me!

Of course, thanks to Trinity for changing my life everyday.

"“How can we think clearly while writing?”

Last month, I had a webinar for students of the University of Nigeria.

Questions asked by the students:

“While writing my mind buzzes with grammatical mistakes...”

— Thoughts are faster than writing. Always, always, always focus on writing first. Get it all out.

“How can we think clearly?”

— Thinking clearly comes with practice. Once you get used to writing and editing repeatedly, you will figure out what to keep and what to discard. Preparing an outline helps.

“Video or text?”

— Context matters. Each platform has its own advantage. On Instagram and Facebook, videos work more. On LinkedIn, I find both to be at par. Remember: consistency wins.

“Should I intern?”

— Yes! Internships help you learn what you don’t know and explore your interests. Internships are trials. Experiment!

Special thanks to Emmanuel Ikonne for having me at this webinar!

I look forward to more webinars for students across the world!

"I had such a long day.

3 lectures
2 prospect calls
1 long orientation in college
2 hours of editing
30 minutes of Nietzsche (That's enough Nietzsche for a day).

All day, I was just waiting to go back home, eat a nice dinner, and sleep.

Then, at 6pm, I got a text from a client.

She wanted a short radio ad script.

Hmm. Ad scripts are fun to write. Lots of storytelling!

I asked her about the deadline.

""Tomorrow morning""

I thought about it. A little. Very little.

I was too eager to write a radio ad script.

I almost instantly said, ""I'll do it.""

I came back home at 9, cooked my dinner, freshened up, and turned my laptop on.

I could barely stay awake, but I really wanted to write this ad.

So I stared at the screen for a few minutes, blank.

I thought, ""Maybe I am too tired for this...""

And suddenly, something sprung in my mind.

A few lines here and a few lines there; my first copy option was ready.

Within the next 15 minutes, I had 2 more copy options ready!

All done.

I just sent the copy to the client.

I was so tired; I still am.

Yet, I wrote the ad and I wrote it well.

Strange things happen when you love what you do.
Ideas... they just come to you.

Now, it's a good night from me!

"I don't use these two words anymore.

Word 1: 'Try'

Why I stopped using this word: My dad told me to.

""I‘ll try to do well in my exams""
""I‘ll try to wake up early”
""I‘ll try to go to the gym 3 times a week""

By saying 'try', you are preparing for failure.

You are conditioning yourself to be comfortable with failure.

Either you give your everything, or you don't.

Either you put in all your effort, or you don't.

As Yoda says, ""Do. Or do not. There is no try.""

Word 2: 'At least'

Why I stopped using this word: Life made me do it.

""At least I slept on time even if I didn't wake up early""
""At least I went to the gym once a week""
""At least I tried...""

Saying 'at least' is a consolation. A pacification.

‘At least’ makes you lower your standard instead of raising the bar.

It's one thing to look at the bright side and work harder next time.

It's another to justify not doing something by explaining the minimum you did.

So yes, I do not use these two words anymore.

I mean, at least I try not to!

"This is what my ‘Clock’ app looks like.

I have over 10 timezones saved on my app.

No, it’s not to just ‘keep up’ with the world’s timezones.

It’s to keep up with my clients’ timezones!

Every time I text my client, send an email, or schedule a call, I check their timezone first.

It helps ensure seamless conversation.

It also allows me to know when I can expect their response.

Indeed, having a list of timezones is beneficial.

But there’s more than that going on here.

I am absolutely thrilled to see this long list on my phone.

It reminds me that I am working with people from across the world.

It reminds me that I am associated with so many different cultures and traditions.

It reminds me that location and timezones don’t matter as long as you’re committed to making it work.

Most importantly, it reminds me that my content is GLOBAL.

"Last year, a client gave me a Diwali ""bonus""...

Last November, I began working on a content writing project for a client.

This was just 1 week before Diwali.

The total amount for the project was INR 10,000.

For this project, my payment terms were simple: 50% advance and rest 50% after completion of work.

I sent the invoice to the client, and since I had worked with him well before, I started the work instantly.

I kept sending him the work updates every other day.

On the 5th day, the client said that he had sent the payment.

Since it was to my Indian account, I asked my dad to check for any credits for INR 5,000.

The next day, my dad messaged me saying I had received a credit... but it was for INR 10,000.

I instantly emailed the client to clarify about the payment.

He wrote back to me, ""We appreciate your work and your promptness, so we considered full payment. Also, happy Diwali!""

This was totally unexpected.

Receiving a Diwali 'bonus' as a freelancer? I'd never thought that would happen!

It made my Diwali truly happy!

Psst... happy Diwali everyone!

"In his recent post, Diptesh Das asked how email copy works...

Here's something to get you started:-

There are 4 important elements to email copy:

1. The subject line
2. The first line of the email
3. The structure of the body
4. The 'P.S.' after the signature (this is done by all excellent copywriters).

These are the features of a good email copy:

1. Be to the point. Very, very essential.
2. Use simple words and short sentences.
3. Use bullet points, headings, subheadings; make it easy to skim through.
4. Build a story around your product/service offering. Explain your pain points that the reader will resonate with, then give your solution.
5. Make it conversational.
6. Present your solution as an experience, not a 'features of this product' list.

That's all there is!

The rest? It's trial and error.

Once you send the emails out, you'll know what to do better.

Emails of different purposes are written differently. You'll pick that up with time.

Don't think about perfecting the email copy, just get started!

"When I write, nothing else exists.

I sit at the desk and turn my laptop on.

I open the document and start typing.

At first, I have no thoughts. I don't know what I am doing.

In a few minutes, I understand what I am supposed to do.

I begin to focus on my work.

20 minutes in, I am completely immersed into my work.

Suddenly, writing feels so effortless. So natural.

I write without thinking too much. It all just flows out.

At this point, I feel in control.

I know I am taking this piece of writing in the direction I want to take it.

Now, I am lost in my writing.

I cannot hear any sound around me. I cannot hear anyone call my name.

Now, I have no sense of time.

How long have I been writing? I don't know. Maybe 13 mins, maybe 7 hours.

Now, I am done. My work is complete.

It's dark outside. I have skipped lunch yet again.

This is so rewarding. Time for a well-deserved dinner.
...
As per Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, this is my 'flow.'

Flow is the state of timelessness, undivided attention, mental peace, and accomplishment, where everything ceases to exist.

When are YOU in the flow?

"“I got into universities in Ireland and UK, which do you suggest is better?”

Many students hit my inbox with this question.

Of course, college decisions are based on many factors; one of the most important being location.

It is easy to decide between two entirely different countries, say, the US and UK.

But when UK and Ireland are so close by (and similar in some ways), there are deeper questions involved.

Here’s why I chose Ireland over UK:

1. Dual degree
— Trinity is the only college that offers a dual degree for the same annual fee as for one subject (I'm pursuing English & Philosophy.)

2. 4-year bachelors'
— Ireland has a 4-year BA like the US; UK has a 3-year BA like India. Certain colleges require a 4-year bachelors' to apply for a Masters programme; so I chose Ireland.

3. Brexit
— Simply put, the Republic of Ireland is independent of the UK. This has led big companies to open up offices in Ireland, creating more job opportunities.

4. Visa
— The Irish visa offered me the option to work in Ireland after completing my degree, unlike the UK visa.

BUT... UK now offers a 2 year work visa after graduation. That changes a lot of decisions!

What do you think is the most important part of making college decisions?

"I won a tongue-twister competition in school because my dad said, ""Say it slowly"".

I was 6 years old at the time.

Our school announced a competition to 'recite' a tongue-twister.

I went home and waited all day for my dad to come back from office.

As soon as he entered the door, I told him about the competition.

I had a list of tongue-twisters written in a double-lined notebook.
I read them out to him in a super-fast tongue-twisting speed.

After I was done, my dad took my notebook and wrote a tongue-twister in it. I took a deep breath and was ready to read it fast, when my dad stopped me.

My dad said, ""Read it slow.""

I found that absurd. It's a tongue-twister... it's meant to be said fast!

He repeated, ""Read it slow. Be clear when you talk.""

I listened to him and memorised the tongue-twister.

In class, all the other students who spoke before me went fast. I started to wonder whether it would be okay if I didn't do that.

When it was my turn, I did what I was prepared for: I spoke at a normal pace; slow and clear.

And... I won first place!

I am still not sure what 'worked'.

What I do know is:
Speaking clearly worked.
Standing out worked.
Listening to my dad worked.

"I totally blanked out in an interview this week...

Earlier this week, I had a group interview for a role in college.

Excited to have been shortlisted for this very competitive role, this interview was very important to me.

I reached 15 mins early for the interview and eagerly waited in the hallway. Soon I was called into the interview room along with 4 more girls.

The format was simple: each person in the group would be asked a question one-by-one.

The questions were interesting and I answered the first two rounds well.

Then, something happened in the final round.

The interviewer asked me a question.
I thought of the perfect answer.

And just as I was about to start speaking...
I went blank.

Totally blank.
My mind froze.

What was happening?!

After a few seconds, I managed to answer the question.

Later, I came out of the room, disappointed in myself.

As I walked back home, I wondered what happened to me. It had never happened before; why did it now?

That's when I realised: I'd only slept 4 hours the previous night.

Just four hours.
And that is not at all okay.

That day, I learnt my lesson.

I may make it through my day with less sleep, but I won't be able to function to my fullest potential.

Reminder: sleep well.

"It’s been a month since I’ve been back in Dublin... and in just one month, there’s been so much to be grateful for.

1. TES

— I’ve talked about this a lot, and I won’t stop talking about it ever. Being the PRO for Trinity Entrepreneurial Society (TES) has been a very rewarding experience in just 1 month.

Viewers love our digital content and the team is incredibly encouraging too. Looking forward to where this will take me in the next 1 year!
[The picture is from yesterday’s TES event]

2. Lectures

— The modules I’m studying this year are very interesting. I find ‘Logic’ in philosophy to be the best; we’re learning how to prove/ disprove arguments ‘mathematically’. Fun!

3. Opportunities

— Last year I was a Fresher and got involved in each and every thing that I possibly could. Thanks to that, I have figured out my interests. I now work towards things I find to be most valuable.

4. Content Writing

— I have completed numerous content writing projects in the last one month, and they have now turned into long-term commitments. This is a crucial phase of content writing (or freelancing in general), and I’m happy to be taking steps for (and into) this.

Very, very grateful for the last 30 days.

What was your September like?

"“Shreya, you are a student. Will you be able to write content for us?”

This is the first question all my prospects ask me.  
It is of course a justified concern.

I am a full-time student.
How will I get the time to work for my clients?
How will I manage studies and work?
What will I do during exams?

At first when prospects asked me this question, I would think ""Okay they are not going to get this done by a student...""

This thought led me to answering with a hundred different things, trying to justify myself to my prospects.

With time, I realised that no one cares HOW I work. All that matters is that I get the work DONE.  
My new response?

""Yes, I can absolutely write content for you. I am writing for more clients who are very happy with the timely work! And of course, I love writing and I am committed to it."" 
The next question is:
'Shreya, what about during exams?'

""I will share the required content well in advance. Your post schedule will be on track."" 
That's it. That's all the prospect wants to know from me. 
Can I work? Yes.
During exams? Yes, in advance.

Sorted.

And now, most of these prospects have turned into long-term clients!

How would you answer this question?

"7 musicians were playing on Grafton Street and only these 2 had a crowd.

[Zoom into the picture and see the audience’s happiness!]

Last week I was walking on Grafton Street, heading back to my college after buying a new book.

While walking, I saw many artists playing different instruments; some singing along.

At the end of the street, I saw a crowd around two performers.

At first I walked past, thinking it was just another song I wouldn’t know.

But then, I was curious: what are these 2 people doing that the other artists weren’t?

So I went back and stood there for 10 minutes.

Here’s what the two artists were doing:
1. Talking to the audience
2. Showing how different guitar chords sounded
3. Explaining how a loop pedal records and repeats the chords on loop
4. Involving the audience by asking them to clap
5. Looping the audience’s claps, further engaging them.

Basically, these 2 artists weren’t just singing, they were also adding value.

They were not just presenting their skills.
They were not teaching either.

They were showing how they do what they do.

You want to get engagement? Add value.

Value wins everywhere: online and offline.

"Today marks one year since the CEO of LinkedIn commented on my post...

... and changed my life forever!

On 24th September 2018, I met ‪Jeff Weiner‬ at an event in college.

I spoke to Jeff for a few minutes, asking him how I could make the most of LinkedIn as a student. 

Jeff was kind enough to stop and talk to me and answer all my questions. He even saw my LinkedIn profile! 

Later that night, I went to my room and posted my experience on LinkedIn, and went off to sleep.

The next day, on 25th September, I was in a lecture at 3pm, and my phone kept buzzing the whole time.

I finally checked my phone after the lecture.

My post had 3,500 likes, and Jeff had commented on my post!

 For the next 3 days, that post kept going up, up, up. It received 14,000+ likes, and I got my first lead from LinkedIn through this post.

 That's when I understood what LinkedIn can do.

LinkedIn is not meant to be a resume, it's meant to be an opportunity-creating platform.

I started writing more, and I shared posts on LinkedIn frequently.

That's why I am here after all this time... still writing!

I am so grateful for this moment. Meeting Jeff, and him commenting on my post, propelled me to be here today.

Forever grateful.

"""I wrote a very good blog with SEO in mind, but it didn't get any views...""

Everyday I get such a message from writers, and also people who've hired writers.

So...
You wrote a very good blog? Yes.

Did you market your blog? *crickets chirping*

A few things:-

1. No one is going to look for exactly the same topic that you published.

2. Your blog needs ENGAGEMENT to rank better, not SEO keywords.

3. Your blog won't be seen unless you show it to a few people, who will then show it to more.

Published a blog?
SHOW IT OFF!

1. Share the link on social media: even WhatsApp stories!

2. Post the first two paragraphs as a LinkedIn article and write ""Click here to read more..."" Direct people to your website.

3. Cross-link! Mention the link of a guest's blog on your blog, and let them mention yours on theirs. Win-win situation!

4. Talk about it. Create the hype. Share posts with context, and end them with 'new blog coming out this Friday'.

5. Start a newsletter, and use your social media, especially LinkedIn, to get sign-ups.

Do one, do two, or do all: MARKET YOUR BLOG.

(Psst: detailed article about interview essentials coming out on 28th September)

See what I did there?

"Yesterday, I interviewed candidates for the Ambassador positions at TES.

Sitting on the other side of the table, I realised what’s involved in the selection process— not just the candidate’s answers.

Here are a few things we (the team of interviewers) noticed and considered to make our decisions:

1. The answers, of course! 

2. Behaviour
— how you greet the interviewers; your posture, hand movements, composure

3. Introduction
— ‘Tell us something about yourself’ is simple, yet very tricky. Your introduction matters most.

4. Keywords
— you have experience, you lead and manage well. All these are great! But they raise more questions: do you work well in a team? Are you open to feedback from peers/juniors? 
— These things should be a part of your answer [ we know if we ask you this, you’ll just say ‘yes’] 

5. Eagerness
— how promptly/enthusiastically you respond shows what you really want

6. Questions
 — your questions help us gauge your interests, skills and prior research.

The next time you have an interview, try interviewing your sibling/ friend/ parent.

By doing this, you’ll find out what behaviour of theirs you like, and what annoys you.

You’ll know what you should NOT do.

Good luck!

"“I read your email subject line, and I had to interview you...”

Today, I had an interview for a blog-writing role on campus.

As soon as I entered the door, the lady greeted me, and the first thing she said was: “I loved your email subject line!”

She said my email subject line caught her attention among all the applications.

She liked how I’d written my email and how I’d shared my profile.

She even liked the crisp questions I’d asked about the role!

I smiled a lot during the whole conversation and kept thanking her.

Last week I was known as the ‘LinkedIn girl’, and now, my email subject line was unique.

It made me so happy to see my writing help me stand out again!

I mean... I got an interview based on how I wrote an email!

This is why I value EVERY piece of writing.

Be it blogs, website content and LinkedIn posts, or personal emails, Instagram captions and WhatsApp statuses... write your best content everywhere.

"Something unexpected (and amazing) happened while I was grocery shopping...

Yesterday, I did my favourite thing in Dublin: grocery shopping!

I was waiting in the queue at the billing counter in Dunnes, wondering how I’m going to carry the 20kg worth of stuff I had in my trolley.

Suddenly, the lady in front of me turned around and asked if I wanted a Dunnes discount voucher.

I didn’t get what she was saying at first, but then she showed me the voucher: ‘€8 off €40 at Dunnes’. She had 2-3 more in her hand, so I took one and smiled and thanked her.

I still couldn’t process how I’d ended up with this significantly big discount voucher in just 5 seconds.

While billing, my shopping totalled up to €38.30, so I ran back inside and bought the Cadbury hot chocolate powder I’d given up on.

The bill hit €40-ish, and then it was down to €32-ish. The voucher worked, and the money-conscious me was ecstatic!

So, that’s what I was grateful for yesterday.

Yes, my shoulders hurt now because of the heavy bags, and yes, I can’t pick my phone up beyond a certain level.

But an unknown lady was kind enough to give me a discount voucher.

Small gestures from strangers can become memorable and important so easily.

Always grateful for such people!

"""Oh you're the girl who writes long LinkedIn posts right?""

Yesterday, I was at a Business event in college.

I did not know anyone, so I just went around saying 'hi', and introducing myself as the Public Relations Officer for the Trinity Entrepreneurial Society [TES].

That's when one person asked me, ""Oh you're the girl who writes long LinkedIn posts right?"" I said yes.

He then asked me, ""Did you write the Facebook description for TES' events?""

I was wondering why he asked me that. He then said ""I loved that 'clink-clink' to cha-ching' line... it was so cool!""

I thought for a second to understand what he was talking about. Then I remembered that line:
""Get ready to go from 'clink-clink' to 'cha-ching' with TES!""

That one conversation made my day!

I was so happy that someone knew me as the 'LinkedIn girl', and also remembered something I wrote!

As a writer, a successful piece of work to me is one that sticks with the readers.

To know that people remembered something like a Facebook event description... I was proud of myself.

So yes, the first week in college has been great! Even when I wasn't in Dublin, people knew me through my LinkedIn posts!

Looking forward to the year!

[Psst: now you know the value of content!]

"I’m flying back to Dublin tomorrow evening.

After a super long vacation of 3 and a half months in Mumbai’s heat and rains, I’ll be back to college next week.

I’m so excited for my Second Year! WOHOO!!!

There are so many things I look forward to this September:

1. Moving back to Dublin!
— It’s going to be really cold, and I’m going to eat a lot of pasta again, but I love living by myself.

2. My ‘Design Thinking’ elective for the first semester
— I’ll learn about product ideation, strategic processes and prototype development; how cool!

3. My roles in the various societies
— I’m most excited about my role as the Public Relations Officer for Trinity Entrepreneurial Society (TES).

4. Freshers’ Week
— The first week of September means 100s of society stalls on campus... means 100 new things to explore!

5. My new room
— I’ve rented a new room, that I’m sharing with an unknown person. I look forward to meeting my new roomie!

6. A new academic year... duh!

When I think of all these things, I am so grateful to be studying in Trinity.

I’m so stoked about yet another amazing year, that’s going to change me in the most beautiful ways possible.

"""I am running a business!!!""

Until a few months ago, I would heavily negotiate with my prospects.

I would quote my price, then the prospects would quote theirs.
In the fear of losing them, I would say okay.

Then one day while I was in a mall, I saw a handbag with a price tag of INR 15,000. Next to it was a similar bag of another brand, with a tag of INR 3,000.

That's when I realised:
> When I go shopping and see a price tag, I can't negotiate with the cashier.

> I can't negotiate just because I am buying 3 handbags.

> I can't negotiate just because I visited their store every week.

So why should I negotiate for content?

THAT was my turning point.

I stopped negotiating.
I stopped giving 'bulk' offers.
I stopped arguing over prices.

I remembered that I run a business, and that I am in charge of what I charge.

That's when my game changed.

What does your game look like?

"Want to get ‘high-paying’ clients?

There’s a very simple solution:
Say NO to low-paying clients!

[...and deliver worth your charges!]

This is one question I get over and over and over again:
“How do I get high-paying clients?”
“How do I find clients who value writing?”
“How to get paid well for content writing?”

The truth is, there are all kinds of clients in the world. You are going to face all kinds while you look for them.

Some people will value your work, others won’t.

Some people will you pay you well, others won’t.

The only way to get high-paying clients is to say no to any other ones.

Value your work and time.

Saying no to a less-paying work means more time to find new clients, better work, and higher pay.

Learn to say NO!

"Last week, I completed my 4th internship!

I took up this internship at a PR Agency after a year of college and freelancing.

Earlier, I used to think ""work is work"", no matter where you do it.

But when I relived a 'get-up-early-and-travel-to-work' routine, I realised how different a full-time job is from freelancing:-

3 things I like about a job:

1. Routine
— I leave from home, and get back home at the same time everyday. My work hours are fixed, Mondays to Fridays.

2. Punctuality
— I need to reach office at a fixed time, and finish the work before the clock hits six.

3. The team
— I've always had amazing people in my team, who have been honest with feedback, and encouraging too!

3 things I like about freelancing:

1. I'm my own boss!
— I decide when, where and how I want to work. Most importantly, I decide WHO I want to work with.

2. I avoid the daily commute
— ... which means more time for finding clients, pitching, and working.

3. Potential for more income
— It takes time, dedication and hard work... and with the right mix, there's a lot of potential here!

Both, full-time job and freelancing, have their own perks.
Internships do help understand which one's for you!

What do you love the most about a job & freelancing?

"The first time I drove a car, I messed up BAD.

I'd just received my driver's license.

When we planned to visit a relative, I volunteered to take the wheel for the 30km drive.

My dad sat in the passenger's seat, guiding me.

Halfway through the drive, we were on an uphill curved road.

I wasn't thinking straight, and ended up putting the car in the wrong gear. The car screeched loud & almost stalled; with a huge truck honking right behind us.

I changed the gear quickly and drove a little further.

In that moment, I panicked.

I panicked so much, I decided to let my dad drive for the rest of the way.

I was ready to stop, when my dad said, ""It's okay, drive.""

I told him I didn't want to drive anymore.

He said it again: ""Drive. You are in that seat now, drive all the way through...""

I drove... slow, taking my time.

I made it all the way.

A few days later, I drove again: better this time.

That's when I realised the importance of my first drive.

If I would have let my dad finish the drive, I would have lost the confidence to start a new one.

If I would have given up, I wouldn't know what to improve on.

Lesson? If you have taken the driver's seat, complete the journey.

It may take time, let it.
Complete it.

Enjoy it!

Hmmmm... that’s a tricky one.

*points towards myself*

This video is for all the prospects, as well as content writers.

What are 2 main things prospects focus on?
1. Work ethics
2. Writing style.

Here are my tips to finding a good content writer!

"I receive 100s of comments every day, and some keep me up all night...

I share posts on LinkedIn almost every day.

My posts are my stories.
They are pieces of my life shared online, in the hope that they provide you value.

Often, people don't like my stories, or my ideals behind my stories. And I appreciate people who counter my opinion by sharing theirs.

But then, there are some comments that are very harsh.

There are some comments that I can't get out of my head.

There are some comments I wish I hadn't read at all.

With time, I have learnt to ignore such people and focus on the positive.

I have learnt that haters are inevitable. There will always be such people around. The more I grow, the more such people I will find.

But as I see more and more content on LinkedIn, I also see more and more haters.

So, I think this is important to be said: Be kind online.

There's a real person on the other side of the screen, who reads your comments and remembers them.

Before you attack someone, think how one comment of yours can affect their life.

Feel free to share your opinions and present your arguments. Please don't forget to be kind.

This is an online world where every word counts.
Make sure it is kind.

"""INR 200 ($2.8) per article... we give topic, you just write""

A few weeks ago, I shared how I was asked to write a 1000-word article for INR 450 (~$6.5).

Today, I received an offer for $2.8!

When I told the lady about my charges, she responded:
""We give topic you just write"".

The response spun my world around!

I thought, 'Umm... did she miss a '0' in the end?'

Then I realised, people truly don't know what goes into 'just' writing.

Dear Prospects,

This is what we writers do for hours and hours and hours:
1. Research
2. Further research
3. Write first draft
4. Edit
5. Edit again, and again, and again
6. Proofread
7. Edit again based on feedback
8. Submit final content.

Please remember:

1. Pay minimum Re. 1 per word.

2. Continuous work does not allow for less pay.
The time, effort and creativity is the same for each piece, why must the pay be less?

3. Writing pays our bills.

Pay well.
Value words.
Respect writers.

"5 things about me [+1 bonus!]:

(Thanks for tagging me, Simran Doshi!)

1. I love animated movies

— I especially enjoy those by Disney and Pixar. I love their sense of humour, creativity and sarcasm a lot!

2. I love putting on eye makeup

— ...and I am really good at it too!

3. I have memorised each and every page of all 24 Tintin books

— As a kid, I would sit with 4-5 books of the Tintin series, and read them back to back for hours. This went on every single day for over 6 years!

4. I wear sports shoes with everything

— To me, comfort is more important than style... especially when it comes to footwear. I even wore sport shoes with a sari once!

5. I LOVE Taylor Swift

— I have been a huge fan of her music as a 10 year old. Now, I am a bigger fan of her personality and ideals.

Bonus:

I donated 2.5 feet of my hair in 2017
— Earlier this year, my sister too did the same.

Psst... if you are planning a haircut, do consider donating for cancer patients :)

"I answered your questions for 85 mins today!

That’s right!

The Instagram Live had over 140 viewers and went on for 1hr 25 mins!

I loved answering all your questions regarding Content Writing, freelancing, clients, LinkedIn and more!

A few questions I loved:

1. What is your biggest lesson?
— Not all clients will like my work, and that’s okay
— I am not obligated to respond to mean/rude comments online

2. How do you handle rude clients?
— I understand whether they are rude with me for my work, or it’s just who they are
— I reconsider whether they are worth working with

3. Where do you see yourself in the next few years?
— I’m not sure yet. I’ve been working on new skills and improving myself, and that’s all I’m focused on
— I want to end up doing something that I will love doing all the time.

I truly enjoyed the session today. Time flew by, and I didn’t even realise it was 5:30!

A huge thank you to all those who joined the live and asked so many wonderful questions!

Definitely looking forward to doing this again!

Have a great weekend!

"My baby sister won 5 medals for writing and debating!

Over the last two days, my sister Sanaya was competing with thousands of students at the World Scholar’s Cup.

The competition involves team debates, essay writing, and quizzes.

When she came home with 5 medals, I was so happy and proud of her!

Being a writer myself, seeing my sister win for writing is such a good feeling.
Wait... I’ve got in-house competition. Ugh.

7 years ago, I’d participated in the same competition and brought home 3 medals and a trophy.

It makes me really happy to see my sister take up the same challenges that I did.

And yes, she is performing much better than me!

It’s amazing that she takes my achievements so positively.

It’s even more amazing that she pushes herself harder every single day.

As an elder sister, everything I do has a massive influence on the younger one.

If you have a sibling, do consider your actions around them.

Each good decision you make will mould your sibling in ways you’ll be proud of :)

"Nike's logo designer was paid $2 (~₹ 130) per hour!

That's right.

In 1971, Carolyn Davidson designed Nike's logo for just $35 (today it’s $221).She was a college student.

Her brief for the logo? It must convey motion and differ from Adidas.

After designing for 17.5 hours, Carolyn came up with the 'Swoosh' logo that conveyed motion and agility.

Although we love the 'Swoosh' logo today, Carolyn's designs were repeatedly rejected when she first made it.

In fact, she was so fed up of the rejections, that she just submitted her design and gave up.

Finally, Nike ended up going with Carolyn's design.

12 years later, Nike boomed BIG.

Nike's owner, Knight, knew that the logo was one of the key reasons for the company's success.

As a gift to Carolyn, Knight gave her 500 shares of the company in 1983.

Today, her shares are valued for thousands of dollars!

And that's how a $35 logo turned into a million dollar success (for Carolyn and Nike)!

So... what's the lesson here?

1. Rejections are natural, and happen to the best of people

2. Do the best you can, repeatedly

3. Always value your own creativity

4. JUST DO IT.

"My comment gained such high engagement in ~12 hours.

I came across a post last night which stated the person was looking for an editor.

The post was just two lines of texts, with the requirement being “catching English mistakes”.

I instantly saw the opportunity to not only apply for the role, but also prove why I am perfect for it.

In my comment, I shared edits that were needed in that post itself.

I explained not only what was wrong, but also how it should be corrected.

My comment stood out from the other comments like “Interested” or “I’m an editor...”

Not only did it stand out, but it also gained 70+ likes from readers!

Lesson?
Take the efforts to be different, even in the smallest things.

There are thousands of people viewing a post.
There are hundreds of people commenting on it.

Don’t blend in.
Stand out.
Always.

"My entry for the #LinkedInCompassionAward made it to the Top 50!

I received this message last night from Shannon McNally.

I read the first few lines, stopped, went back to the first few lines, and read them again.

I then realised what this was about, and I was so happy to have been recognised!

My video entry for this award was shot on the last day of submissions.

[link to my entry video in comments]

I had initially thought “There will be 1000s of entries by established initiatives... what can our idea do?”

But then, on the last day, I decided to make a video and submit my entry.

And I am so HAPPY I took that step!

Making it to the Top 50 is amazing!

A huge thank you to LinkedIn for having this contest!

I am so glad that an initiative by a few students in Dublin made it to the Top 50 entries.

I am so glad that our idea to solve the homelessness crisis in Ireland spreads compassion in the world!

And as always, there’s a lesson here too:
Give yourself a chance.

Don’t think of the challenges.
Don’t think of the outcome.

If you want to do something, do it.

Create your own opportunities by showing up.

"""The pay is Rs. 450 ($6.5) per article of 1000 words...""

I just received this message on LinkedIn.

The prospect wanted 30 articles per month.
Criteria? Well-researched, referenced and SEO-friendly.

All I can say is that this is supremely absurd and ridiculous.

Writing a blog requires creativity, time, extensive research, editing, proofreading, and so much more. Working at such rates is also very mentally stressful for the writer.

Dear Prospects:
Please understand the resources that go into creating content every single day.
Please understand what content writers do, and please PAY for the value of the content.
We've got bills to pay too.

Dear Content Writers:
Please SPEAK UP.
And please stop accepting offers like this!

Know your value... it determines the complete market's value.

"""I wish I didn't have to ask you this... but could you pay me some more for this project?""

Yesterday evening, I was lying on the sofa, when my dad said my bank account was credited. I wasn't expecting any payments...

Then, I sprung up, checked my texts.

Just an hour ago, I had texted a long-time client about my budget trouble for the current project.

We had sealed the deal weeks ago.

But the project was falling unexpectedly expensive to me.

I finally decided to ask the client for some help.

I texted him about my problem, and requested him to help me in any way he could.

And to my surprise, he not only agreed, but made the payment within an hour!

This one kind gesture from my client helped me out a lot.

It quickened the decision process for this project, and even taught me to consider the smallest details in my quote.

I'm glad to be writing for this client.
And I am glad I asked for help.

Just one text made all the difference!

"My first LinkedIn post went viral with over 14,000 likes and 20,00,000+ views.

That day, I thought I had figured LinkedIn out.

But when I posted more, the engagement was much lower.

It took me 5 months to understand what I needed to change.

And then it took me another 5 months to implement these changes.

Today, after 10 months, I have learnt how to successfully replicate high-engagement posts.

How did I do this?

"""My post has high engagement of 25,000 views, but I didn't get any leads...""

I get this message often that a post got so many views, but it didn't help the person generate leads.

First, picture this:

1. You walk by a chocolate store
2. You like how big and attractive the store is
3. You stop and enter the chocolate store
4. You explore the store, inquire about the chocolates
5. You buy a chocolate, or leave the store with a pamphlet.

The number of views you get is the number of people who walked by (scrolled past) your post.

The engagement is the number of people who liked the first few lines of your post, explored it, and, liked, commented and shared it.

Now, remember this: Number of views is not engagement!

Likes, comments, shares and direct messages are engagement.

So... how do you get more engagement on your LinkedIn posts?

Coming out tomorrow: My 'Top 5 Tips to Getting Amazing Engagement on LinkedIn'!

"“Hey Shreya, what course have you done for content writing?”

“Can you please share the course? I want to do it too...”

Here’s the answer:
I have not done any course for content writing.

I’ve been writing in some form or the other since I was 8 years old.

I’ve had a good command over English in terms of spelling and grammar since I was a kid.

I interned at various media houses for over a year, where I understood professional content writing.

I’m now pursuing a degree in English Literature and Philosophy, which helps me analyse and improve my work.

You don’t need a course to learn content writing.
Instead, you just need to write!

1. Develop the basic skills of correct spellings, grammar, sentence formation, vocabulary, etc.

2. Study the content you like the most.
Understand the blogs.
The Instagram captions.
The Facebook ads.
The billboards and hoardings.

3. Observe the content around you, and think how you’d make it better.

4. Emulate (not copy!) this content.

5. Create content from scratch.

There is no perfect course. Don't spend time looking for one.
You just need to write!

Bonus: STUDY 'Cashvertising' by Drew Eric Whitman, and 'On Writing' by Stephen King

"I once told a client to CHANGE his brand tagline!

He was a new client.

He had a spot-on vision for his brand and was very dedicated towards it.

I was very excited to work on an idea like that because I completely resonated with it.

He had shared his brand’s logo with me.

I immediately noticed that his tagline was creative, but didn’t match his goals. It seemed inappropriate for his vision.

I was very hesitant to tell him that. He was a new client. I did not want to seem overboard, and did not want to upset him.

After a lot of (quick) back and forth, I wrote him a text.

I wrote to him why his tagline seemed inappropriate, and I also suggested a new tagline.

He thought about it, and we eventually moved on with the new tagline. And he was very happy about it!

At the end of the day, everyone wants a good brand image and lots of creativity. If you can improve something, say it.

The client may disagree, but well... you’ve done your part.

If you can make something better, do it.

#ShreyaWrites

Psst... still working with that client; one of the best I’ve had! (I’m sure he knows that too, haha)

"What if you just texted ""3"" and got 3 wine bottles delivered to you?

I came across Gary Vaynerchuk's ingenious method of selling wine digitally:

- You get a text message with the day's offer
- You reply with the number of bottles you want
- Order confirmed.

No wifi.
No internet.
No details and confirmations each time.
Just a text message, with the number of bottles you want.

Why is this GENIUS?

1. Super duper convenient
2. One decision to consider: number of bottles wanted
3. Intriguing, hence most people will reply just to 'try'
4. Same old wine. BRAND NEW marketing.

Wondering what else can be marketed in this way... can content be?
Thoughts?

"""Shreya, how much should I charge...?""

Here are 3 important factors to consider while charging for different forms of content:

1. Blogs
- i. Niche
- ii. Word count
- iii. Research required

2. Social media posts
- i. Number of posts
- ii. Social media handles + nature of posts
- iii. Graphic designing involved?

3. Website
- i. Number of webpages
- ii. Content density on each webpage
- iii. Edit draft content/ write from scratch?

4. Presentations
- i. Number of slides
- ii. Designing of slides?
- iii. Time needed (content + images/ icons + designing)

Always consider the resources involved, especially your time. If something is research-heavy and requires a lot of time, charge more.

Charge worth the work and work every minute.
And of course, deliver awesome quality work.

Need pricing details for any other forms of content?
Comment, and I'll answer that for you!

"""Hi Shreya, thanks for the reminder, had missed out on replying...""

I had emailed 3 prospects about 2 weeks ago.

For 2 weeks, I didn't hear back from them.

So I dropped them a reminder, and they said they would get back to me in 2-3 days.

I waited for 3 days, and received no response.

I did not want to seem too pushy, and I did not want to spend time on a deal that seemed unlikely. So I did not email them.

On the 5th day, I thought it was worth a shot to drop a short 'I am waiting' reminder email. After all, I had nothing to lose.

So, I emailed all 3 people.

And I am now working with 2 of them.

Sometimes people genuinely miss out on replying to your emails.

Although follow-ups may seem aggressive or too persistent, you must do it a few times.

If they still don't reply, you can take the decision to move on to other prospects.

But: if someone has genuinely forgotten to reply, this follow-up email will restart the conversation.

Following up is a very important aspect of pitching.
Do it.

"I chose the more painful surgery option for long term benefits...

I recently underwent an eye surgery for vision correction.

I had two major options:
1. LASIK
2. PRK Laser

Both options involve different procedures: the cornea is treated differently.

Option 1: It is the latest procedure. The recovery is majorly painless, and vision is restored within a day.

Option 2: It is the first ever laser eye surgery. It requires a painful 2-day healing time, and needs upto 10 days to restore clear vision.

I chose the second surgery option.

Why?

Because: To me, the long term benefits mattered more than the instant gratification.

My goal was not just to regain my sight instantly.
My goal was to regain the best possible sight for years to come.

I experienced a lot of discomfort for 3 days.

But I kept saying to myself, ""This pain is just for now. It's going to be over, and you will be grateful for your decision.""

My point is this: sometimes, to get the most out of something, you have to give up comfort.

When it comes to your career, passion, personal happiness; anything at all: the initial struggles need to be faced. Bravely.

The best things demand sacrifices.

Know when to make those sacrifices.

You will thank yourself later.

"My mom read out LinkedIn posts to me after my surgery...

I got an eye surgery earlier this week.

My eyes were shut for about three days.

Since I couldn't see, my mom read out my emails, texts and LinkedIn notifications twice a day. (My amazing mom: Pooja Pattar)

While she was at it, she also read out a few LinkedIn posts by Ashi Singhal, Sandeep Kochhar, Hardik Lashkari, Faisal Z. Anwer and more!

While I heard her 'narrate' the posts, I realised how much the form of storytelling has evolved digitally.

That's what I mean when I say: add value through your posts by sharing personal stories... they are the best kind to read.

But, this post is more than about LinkedIn.

Shoutout to my mom for keeping up with my 100s of LinkedIn notifications these past few days!

Shoutout to my mom for taking care of her grown-up daughter who had turned into a new born baby!

Shoutout to my mom for being the amazing woman she is and looking after me day and night!

Made it through this week only thanks to her :)

Psst... I also won the #careerstory competition by Edumilestones .com I received so many comments on the winner announcement post, thank you all very much!!!

Psst 2... I am doing well now. Still need some time to get back to work :)

"I received a rather surprising message yesterday:

“Thanks, Shreya!

You are helping me grow with the posts you like,

If on my feed I see ’Shreya liked’ I definitely read that post. And each time I hit a wisdom jackpot.”

I never realised this.

But I think it’s an amazing aspect about not only leveraging LinkedIn, but leveraging your personal brand.

You express yourself not only through your posts that you write.

You express yourself through the posts you like.

You express yourself through the comments you share.

The posts you engage with tell a lot more about you than the posts you write.

So pay attention to the posts you engage with too.

It matters. A LOT.

"I messaged 2 clients that I need more time for completing the work since I am sick.

Here are the (surprising) responses I received:

Client 1:

“Ohhh so sorry ur not well😞
But ur a strong and extraordinary💪🏻 woman
If u can deliver, it's well n good and if not it's fine”

Client 2:

“Since you are not well, please take care... You can submit by Tuesday. I don't want work at the cost of your health. My policy...
Should I take away one or two threads?
Will that ease out for you”

These are the original messages I received. I am sharing this to prove that there are such kind people in the world.

I thought such compassion would be uncommon, especially in the content world.

But the more clients I find, the more I realise how caring and considerate they can be.

To see such clients, who have since been checking up on my health, is an amazing thing.

I’m so glad I’m writing for such wonderful people. Makes me really happy! :)

Yes, there are people who value content, and people who value YOU more.

If you’ve found them, you are very very lucky.

"I did something NEW today!

I have been crazyyyyy busy this week.

I have been spending 18 hours on my computer or my phone, typing all day every day.

So, when I received queries in my inbox today, I just didn't want to type any more. (How ironic to this post!)

What did I do?

I responded with a quick voice note!

And the responses I got? Amazing!

The first line everyone wrote back was 'I loved hearing your voice...'

It's a really different experience for me, and it's so much more personal to respond with a voice note.

Definitely going to explore the power of voice more now.

It saves time too!

Also, so glad that people love my voice as much as they love my writing xD

Now that I have typed this post too, let me get back to my crazy week.

Happy weekend everyone!

"I got a 6-month writing deal because I replied to a message.

A few days ago, a gentleman on LinkedIn sent me the link to his blog, asking me to check it out.

I went through his blog and noticed some errors in the headline.

I sent him a few alternative headlines, hoping it would help him out.

He thanked me for the correction, saying I was the only one who had replied to him.

A few minutes later, he asked me if I would like to write for him.

We discussed his requirements in detail.

Within one hour, the deal was finalised… as a 6 month contract!

THIS is the power of REPLYING to messages on #LinkedIn!

This entire conversation took place only because I replied to his message!

Not only did I drop a generic reply, I showed him the error, and provided him a solution as well.

I did it because that’s what I do.

And, it worked wonders for him... and me!

I spent 2 mins reading a blog. 2 mins writing a response.

And now, I have a 6 month writing contract.

What a day!

"""Hey Shreya, I need a short sample...""

I held my breath.

I stared at the message for a minute.

""I'll pay for the sample too.""

I read this and just lit up!

A prospect messaged me this yesterday.

I confirmed with him again, and I agreed to writing the sample instantly.

I love it when people truly value content and my time.

When someone values my work right from the beginning, it makes the project so much more exciting and worthwhile!

And of course, such clients are an absolute delight to work with!

I just emailed him the sample before writing this post.

Now, I am eagerly awaiting his response... and equally excited to write for him!

Yes, people do value content. And it absolutely made my day!
Hope this post makes yours :)

"""Hey Shreya, how much should I charge for #content?""

There is no 'perfect' price for content.

If you are starting out, here are some basic factors to consider for pricing:

- Niche
- Number of words
- Frequency of work
- Nature of work (are you writing from scratch, do you get a draft, will you be outsourcing any work, etc)
- Research involved
- Time needed
- Taxes
- Company position [yes, this matters]
- Fussy clients [yes, this matters too!]
- Minimum monthly income through content writing.

How to use these factors:
- Bulk work? Offer discounted rates
- Less time? Increase rates
- Lot of research? Increase rates...

Consider all these factors and chart out a suitable fee.

"""Hi Shreya, I'm planning to start a blog. Any advice?""

Yes.

One advice:

Stop planning. Just START!

There is a lot that goes into blogging:

- understanding how to use a website
- creating a website
- planning and writing content
- always posting quality content
- maintaining adequate frequency of sharing content
- making it through writer's block...

You won't know what to work on until you start blogging.

You won't know how much you know until you start blogging.

You won't know what exactly you need advice for until you start blogging.

JUST START!

"""I saw that you are a #Content #Writer. So what do you do exactly?""

I get this question a LOT.

What do I write?

- compelling content on websites
- exciting and creative blogs, articles
- instagram and facebook posts that you love to share
- informative product brochures and pamphlets
- amazing brand emails you get
- ads that you just can't not click
- such engaging LinkedIn posts!

What's the purpose of this content?

- establish brands
- create good perception of people towards the brand
- build a brilliant brand presence online and offline (I love doing it!)

How do I do this?

- I strategise content
- I research content
- I write content
- I edit content
- I design content
- I post content
- I analyse content

Why do I do this?

- I love content :)

"""Hi Shreya, thanks for connecting!""

A lot of people write this to me once I accept their connection request.

Initially, I used to just hit the 'It's my pleasure' or 'You're welcome' buttons prompted by #LinkedIn.

Now, I write back:
""Thank you for connecting too! :)""

I love writing this reply.

Why?
- Connecting on LinkedIn is a two way street
- Someone took the effort to send me a connection request
- Someone thought of thanking me for connecting with them.

And then, I get a startled reply about how my message stood out.

Then starts a conversation!

How do you reply to a 'thanks for connecting' message?

"“Please share your work portfolio…”

Few months ago, this question from my prospective clients would stall me.

I talked about my experience, but when it came to sharing a #content work portfolio, I would go blank.

I used to think: “I’ve just started out. What work could I have possibly done worth a portfolio?”

Then I realised what a work portfolio is truly about.

It is not about showing what I have done for other clients.

It is about showing the client that I KNOW what I am doing, and that I am the BEST at it.

Then, I started sharing a very simple work portfolio:
- My best #LinkedIn posts
- My articles published in my college’s newspaper, website, magazines, etc

Why did this work?

The posts and articles showed:
- consistency of writing
- writing skills in various niches and of various lengths
- high engagement on my posts were a ‘real life demonstration’ of my work.

As a #fresher, this approach turned out to be the best.

Once the clients saw my published work, they knew I‘m serious about this. I would get deal confirmation calls the very next day!

What’s in your work portfolio?

"""WHAT IS SHE DOING???""

(My hostel horror story)

Last year, I moved to Dublin for college.

I was living in a hostel for the first time, sharing a room with someone I had never met before!

One night, I was sitting on my bed, quietly working on my laptop.

The sun had set completely, and it was pitch black outside.

Suddenly, I heard a horrifying sound...

The horrifying sound of... NAILS BEING CUT!

I completely freaked out! I screamed at my roommate in my head, ""What is she doing???""

Since I was a child, I have never cut my nails after sundown.

Seeing my roommate cut her nails at this hour was truly shocking!

At that very minute I realised how different cultures are across the world.

One thing we aren't ever taught in school or told about is how to understand, respect and accept different traditions.

This small incident taught me how to be open to all unique and contrasting cultures, and not be startled by them.

Psst... I did speak to my roommate about this, and yes, we had a nice laugh!

A truly horrifying night it was!

"""Hey Shreya, I'd love to feature your #blog on my website. I'd be happy to pay for it!""

My first client found me on #LinkedIn.

My first post went viral, leading him to me.

At that time, I didn't think twice. I just said yes to the work.

I was really excited about working on something like this for the first time!

I was given 15 days to give the first draft.

For 13 days, I stalled. I kept writing and deleting and rewriting 5 words.

Before even having written the article, I was very worried about the feedback I would get.

On the 14th day, I finally sat down and wrote the article in one go.

I edited it.
I re-edited it.
Then I proofread it.

Finally, I sent it to the client.

And... he loved it!

It was published on his website the very next week!

This first client experience taught me a lot:

1. Don't overthink it, just do it
2. Clients are good with feedback, don't stress
3. If you put out good content, prospects will come to you
4. Content can be very well paid.

What did you learn from your first client?

"Sometimes, I just want to stop.

Sometimes, everything feels too much.

I have heard 'we'll get back to you' so many times in the past one year.

I've made a hundred calls, and written #content for 1 out of them. At times, maybe not even that.

I've been in college for hours, worked for another 5, slept for 3, and done it all over again.

So many times, I just want to stop.

But when I want to stop, I think of this:

There are 7 billion people in the world.

There are 550mn+ people on #LinkedIn.

I must have spoken to 500, got a deal with 5.

There are so many more people left.

There are so many more #opportunities.

And then, I imagine what it'll be like when I actually make it.

I think about all the amazing results I'll keep getting during the process, and how amazing it will feel.

I think about how much I've done in 1 year, and how MUCH MORE I can do in another one.

When I want to stop, I think about what it would be like to achieve everything I have ever wanted.

And then?

Then, I KEEP GOING.

"""We can pay INR 5,000 a month."" I agreed.

I recently spoke to a prospect for monthly social media posts.

I understood their #content requirements and quoted my price.

They came back a week later saying their budget is INR 5,000 a month, for 25 social media posts. Including graphic images.

I normally say ""Please come back when you have a better budget.""

This time, I agreed to their offer.

I said, ""You give me INR 5,000. I'll give you what I can do for that much: 3 posts.""*

If you can negotiate on your price, I can negotiate on my work.

Pay less if you want. But you'll only get what you pay for.

After all, you get what you give.

"“We don't have a budget for #content...""

Every day, I hear this from at least one prospect.

They share their requirements, I quote my price.

Then they say,

""Our other expenses are high, please reduce price for content...""

""We didn't think content would cost us so much...""

""We don't have a fixed budget for content, but maybe we can pay INR 5,000 per month for everything..."" ($72)

Why do companies NOT INCLUDE content in their budget?

You plan for salaries, business investments, recruitment costs, electricity, office space, travel, etc.

If you have planned for everything else, why isn't content a part of your marketing plan?

If you're spending fixed amounts on the above mentioned things, why are you negotiating on the aspect of content?

Saying your expenses are high does not permit you to 'save' on content. Content should be a part of your #budget.

The next time you strategise your business plan, INCLUDE content.

#Content is a HUGE deal. Hell, it is THE deal.

Make the investment in content.

"""Why are you working during your vacations? Get some rest!""

I've currently taken up a summer job at a PR Agency.

Whenever I tell someone about this, they ask why I am working instead of 'taking a break'.

My answer to this is: I don't want to take a break!

I love what I am doing, and I want to keep getting better at it.

Yes, I do feel overwhelmed at times. I do end up pausing, thinking I've got a lot on my plate.

BUT I'm the one who put it all on my plate. And I like it that way.

I love doing something that is constantly pushing me to be the best, and I don't want to stop.

Plus, how can I take a break during the best years of my life?

If I stop to take a break now, how will I reach where I want to be?

Remember: It's okay to work as much as you can and as much as you want to. Just prioritise your health.

Don't let the idea of a 'vacation' stop you... use it to get ahead!

"""How do I make #money from my blogs?""

""I've written a few blogs. How do I sell my blogs?""
I've been getting such messages a lot lately.

Here's the real, honest answer:

To make money off of writing, you need to be known for your #writing.

You need #VISIBILITY.

You need to write, share, publish #content, and establish yourself #online.

After all, you can't seal the deal with a company which doesn’t know you exist, right?

In fact, you need visibility to do anything at all.

Want your favourite job?
Want to bag an interview?
Want to raise funds?

For all of it, you need to get yourself out there.

Once you do this, the things you love will start coming TO YOU.

Establish yourself. Be visible!

"I work 7 days a week.

I work on the weekdays. And on weekends.

On the weekdays, I work a 9-5 summer job.

On the weekends, I work for my clients, and focus on improving my skills.

I make calls on the weekends, finalise deals, start the work, make more calls, and spend time writing, writing, and... writing.

I do this because I love #writing.

I want to invest all the time I possibly can to get ahead in this industry.

Remember: There’s nothing wrong in working 7 days a week.

Of course, take a break once in a while, and prioritise your health over everything else.

But if you love doing something, why should you not spend all the time you can doing that something?

Make sure you think about this the next time you read the repeatedly plagiarised Boss-Employee joke:

“
Boss: When I was your age, I used to work 12 hours a day and 7 days a week and that's why I am where I am today...

Employee: When I am your age I want to share happier stories with my subordinates. So, see you Monday Boss.
“

Working 7 days a week can give you happy stories too. In fact, it will show your happiness without you having to even talk about it!

"Something wonderful happened today!

I have a habit of saying '#thank #you' to the bus driver while I get down.

I'm home in #Mumbai for my vacations. I've been travelling to work by the local BEST buses since 3 weeks.

Every day, before getting down, I #thank the driver.

Today, a lady got down one stop before me.
To my surprise, she said a 'thank you' to the driver!

Then, the lady looked at me, smiled, and got down.

This small incident made me smile today. I had never heard anyone else say this before!

To know that simple gestures can catch on so easily makes me really #happy.

To know that small things can create a big difference makes me really happy.

It's true: #Gratitude is a wonderful thing!

If you travel by bus, please do thank the driver.

It will make him happy, and it will make you happy too :)

"Freelancer? No! #Content #writer.

I have never called myself a #freelancer.

When someone asks what I do, I say I am a content writer.

Why do I not call myself a 'freelancer'?

- The word is low-rent

- I am not a kid who's sitting in bed, eating chips, watching Netflix, writing articles

- This is not a side gig, this is what I #DO

- I don't need the word 'free' associated with my work

- I don't want to be undervalued because of a misunderstood word.

Freelancers are fighting over minimal pay.

Content writers are competing over the best #pay.

What you call yourself matters.

Know your #value.

So... what do you call yourself?

"""Why are you charging so much if you give #content in just 2 days? It doesn't even take up your time!""

Here's the data:

- I write, edit and share a #LinkedIn post in 15 mins.
- I write a 500-word blog in 40 mins.
- I edit 2,500 words in 60 mins.
- I write social media content for a month in 120 mins.

Here's the fact:
Taking less #time does not mean compromising the #quality.

Here are the other facts:

- I can write a LinkedIn post in 15 mins because I spent 2 hours on it every single day for 8 months.

- I can write a blog in 40 mins because I spent 3 hours on it twice a week for 5 months.

- I can edit 2,500 words in 60 mins because I spent a day editing one long essay every week.

- I can write social media content in 120 mins because I spent a week on it for over a year.

My charges aren't for my time.

My charges are for my #value.

And I have this value because I invested time and efforts in improving my #content #writing skills by 1000x in just a year.

It's time for returns :)

Plus, you get kickass content in just 2 days. Isn't that really something! :)

"""You're so lucky you have your life figured out at such a young age""

I heard this a lot when I said I wanted to be a #Content #Writer.

I was 18.

Although happy to hear it, I didn’t always have this clarity.

I was studying science in high school.

I spent hours in the class and in tuition, shivering, wondering why they kept the AC at 16°.

I flunked many #exams for 2 years. My answer sheets had gaps, and my question paper had poems scribbled all over them.

I went through my lowest lows during this time. It wasn't because I was failing exams, but because I was not even concerned about failing them.

I would fail, and it never bothered me. Because I never cared about what I was doing.

Then I decided I only wanted to do things that I would NEVER be okay failing at. I decided I wanted to do something that pushed me to be the best I could.

So, one day before my NEET, I gave the SAT.

And now, I am studying English Literature & Philosophy at one of the best colleges in the world.

I am writing content for some of the best clients, while earning enough to pay my own monthly bills.

My point is: it's okay to have nothing figured out. It's okay to flunk a few papers, it's okay to be clueless about your future.

The only thing to do is: NEVER STOP working on yourself.

"I NEVER charge per word.

Quoting a price is much more than finance. It is all about the human #psyche. It's about understanding how the mind perceives information.

Suppose I quote ""INR 8 per word for a 400-word blog*"".

Here's what happens:

1. This statement starts a tedious process of calculation in the reader's mind

2. The reader starts multiplying 400 with 8, and starts worrying about the number of digits in the end result

3. It makes the reader compare my charge to the value of one word, than the overall article (1 word= INR 8??? Oh my God!)

4. It creates the perception that I am charging TOO high for #content.

BUT...

When I quote ""INR 3,200 for a 400-word blog*"", the game changes.

Then:

1. The brain is spared of calculations where 2 small numbers create a much larger one

2. The reader considers the overall amount being paid for the value of a complete #article.

A #blog is much more than a set of words put together. So why charge per word?

Charge for the #value you provide.

#ShreyaWrites #tips #freelancers

*the mentioned prices are for example only; I charge higher than this :)

"What's one thing you wish you knew about a #career when you were 15?

I wish I knew that I couldn't really decide my life at 15.

I wish I knew that I don't have to stick with the decisions I made at 15.

I wish I knew that I don't need to join #college right after high school.

I wish I knew that there's more to my career than slogging in classes all day to clear one exam.

I wish I knew that I had #time to figure everything out for myself.

Although I didn't know this then, I feel so blessed to have experienced and learnt this by 18.

When I meet kids who are at this point in life now, I tell them:
You don't need to decide NOW. You've got time. Just do what you #love, and the rest will fall in place :)

What's one thing you wish you knew about a career when you were 15?

"I've stopped liking posts on #LinkedIn.

I’ve changed the way I ‘like’ posts.

First, I read the #post.
Second, I think about the essence of the post.
Third, I 'react' to it.

#Celebrate
- I click this for posts which talk about a celebration, be it graduation, exam results, a success story, a first job, a promotion, etc

#Love
- I click this for stories which inspire me, and make me really happy to read!

#Insightful
- I click this when I learn something very unique and new, that I had never thought of before

#Curious
- I click this when I am looking forward to knowing more about what the post says, or when the post asks a question that I'm curious to know the answer to.

Reacting to a post is a very good #tool on LinkedIn.

Reacting to a post is more than just a 'like'.

It is a wonderful way of easily assessing the post before reading it.

It helps one decide which post is worth a read.

It also develops the habit of personal reflection, about what one learnt from the post.

I sometimes (on busy days) decide whether to read a post based on the reactions it has! I tend to always read the ones with an 'Insightful' reaction.

So, what's your reaction to this post?

"“He told me no one would pay for my first #internship, so I didn’t ask for a stipend”

A friend told me this about her internship search experience.

An elder person told her that no one would pay for the first internship.

So, my friend never looked for a paid internship, and settled with whatever she could find.

This is FALSE.

My first internship was paid.

1. You CAN get a #paid internship. And you SHOULD.

- Yes, you are learning. But, you’re also adding unique #value to the workplace
- You are investing time, efforts, energy and creativity— why shouldn’t you be paid?

2. Not all advice is good advice

- Don’t settle with what others say. Do your own research. #Create your own worth.

#Students, learn to ask for what you deserve.

A minimal #stipend is essential.

You won’t get it until you #ask for it.

Ask.
Ask.
Ask.

"How we are changing the world through compassion!
#LinkedInCompassionAward

Do you know what a person needs to improve his/ her life? A roof over their head. A home.
When a person has a home, they can pursue their dreams and focus on improving themselves & their community.

I’m working with a group of students in #Dublin to address the homelessness crisis in #Ireland affecting 10,000+ people.

Our solution:
• ‘Personal Profiling’
• train & upscale skills of the homeless and connect them to people with homes through AI & tech
• help the homeless achieve financial integration in mainstream and make them independent to take care of their basic needs

The #LinkedInCompassionAward will give us:
• visibility
• ability to work with government & influential individuals
• opportunity to create global impact

LinkedIn’s benefits:
• #LinkedInLearning:
— upscaling skills of the homeless
• massive network of 500mn+ :
— connect them to jobs & entrepreneurs.

I hope #LinkedIn supports us in our lifelong journey to change the world through compassion!

We‘re #In It Together.

"""I worked for one whole month, and they paid me Rs. 0""

I met a friend recently who told me about his #internship. He worked from home for a start-up, developing apps and websites for them.

He invested 10 hours each day, 5 days a week, for 1 whole month.

In a month, the start-up changed its Manager. Finally, when it came to the payment, my friend did not get anything.
The new Manager had no previous approval letter with him, and said the company will not be using his work, so they will not pay for the work.

Why did all this happen? Because my friend had no written confirmation #letter.

The job approvals were in an informal manner on WhatsApp.

His 'offer letter' was a simple message: 'Welcome to XYZ'.

There was no written and signed approval stating the work or stipend.

This is a very important lesson, especially for #students:

Do NOT work without a written, signed, stamped #offer #letter which CLEARLY states the work, duration and stipend of the job.

WhatsApp is NOT okay. Written emails are NOT okay.

Make sure you have an original signed and stamped letter posted to you, or a scan over email.

Be aware. Always have proof.

"""I cannot write because I don't have a #niche...""

This is what I thought when I first started out writing.

Every blog I saw was about a particular thing: travel, food. diy, fashion, social media...

I did not know much about one specific topic, and so I never posted or published articles.

Then, I started writing about my #daily experiences.

I wrote about the people I met, the places I went, the topics discussed in my lectures, my internship stories and such.

By posting #personal stories on #LinkedIn, I realised that I don't need a niche to start writing.

All I need to do is: #START #WRITING.

Topics follow.
And now I’ve found my favourite things to write about.

Don’t wait for a niche. Just #write and share #content.

"“Shreya, how do I get high-paying international clients?”

My #LinkedIn is bursting with such messages.

Here is my answer: you don’t.

1. There is no such thing as ‘high-paying’ clients. There are only clients. The rest depends on persuasion and your #value for your own work.

Another way is to drop the ‘Chalta Hai’ (‘it’s okay’) attitude and not work for cheap rates at all.

2. I’ve raised invoices worth ₹25,000 ($360) for #Indian clients. Indians DO pay well for content.

3. You don’t need to go looking for clients. They’ll come to you.

All you need to do is create and share kickass #content RELENTLESSLY. You never know who’s watching.

My consistency on LinkedIn has led me to a point where I get one #client enquiry for each LinkedIn post I make.

One post = one potential client.

It only grows EXPONENTIALLY.

And this is my THIRD post today...

"""With 5 years of experience in writing you should be at a level of 6 Rs. per word"" ($0.08pw!)

Pardeep Goyal has said it right.
The common response he received was: no one pays #content #writers so much.

Reality:

I've worked with clients who have paid $200 (~Rs. 14,000) for one presentation.

I've written for clients who've paid $100 (~Rs. 7,000) for one article (Rs. 18pw)

I paid my own bills for 5 months in one of the most expensive cities in the world, #Dublin.

The best part?
The clients continue to come back with more work.

Your value is bigger than your experience years. It's about how much you invest in improving your #skills.

I had started with 'market' rates myself. Then I found out that people are willing to #pay as long as I am willing to #ASK.

#Invest in yourself. Charge your #worth.

"""But I'm too young to start a #venture!""

She was 9 when she decided she wanted to be a #singer.

At 11, she would have her mom drive her to record labels around Nashville. She would say her name, followed by ""I’m 11.. I want a record deal.. Call me!”

By 14, she had signed various record deals.

At 17, she released her first country album.

Today, Taylor Swift is a #global pop star, selling $935.4 million worth of tickets through 6 world tours!

So, what did Taylor Swift do that helped her achieve so much in just 13 years?

She started #young.

'The sooner you start, the more mistakes you make. And the more mistakes you make, the sooner you learn from them and the better you understand how to not make them again.'

Don't be afraid to #start young.

"""INR 3,000? ($43) That's TOO MUCH for content!!!""
Are you sure?

Billboards on the roads
Descriptions on your toothpaste and soaps
Ads on your phone
Memes that you screenshot
Heart-wrenching video links you share
The notifications from your apps
Netflix Original web series you watch on repeat...

EVERYTHING IS CONTENT.

#Content is often categorised as something meant for #brand #promotion.

The reality is: Content IS the brand.

Paying for content is an #investment, not an expense. It generates more leads than any other method of marketing.

Content is (sadly) 'cheap' right now, and maybe that is why it is underestimated. Don't make that mistake; understand the importance of content.

So, the next time you think about content, think about the manifold returns it will bring you.

Think of the #value. Not just the cost.

"An important thing on LinkedIn is creating #INFLUENCE.

What matters on LinkedIn is the impact you have on people.

How do you influence people?
By sharing posts which have a #purpose.
And by adding value through your posts.

Sharing valuable posts consistently builds #importance.

And THIS is the right time to strike!

Once you've built importance, pick a niche.
And be the #BEST at it.

Be so good that every time someone comes across that niche, they think of #YOU.

If you are writing about creating content, then your connections must think of you when it comes to #content.

If you are writing about using LinkedIn, then your connections must think of you when it comes to #LinkedIn.

If you are writing about interviews, then your connections must think of you when it comes to #interviews.

Whatever you choose to write about, remember to add priceless #value.

Numbers will follow: on your posts, and in your bank account :)

"“Please share your work portfolio…”

Few months ago, this question from my prospective clients would stall me. I talked about my experience, but when it came to sharing a #work #portfolio, I would go blank.

I used to think: “I’ve just started out. What work could I have possibly done worth a portfolio?”

Then I realised what a work portfolio is truly about.

It is not about showing what I have done for other clients.

It is about showing the client that I #KNOW what I am doing, and that I am the #BEST at it.

Then, I started sharing a very simple work portfolio:
- My best #LinkedIn #posts
- My #articles published in my college’s newspaper, website, magazines, etc

Why did this work?
The posts and articles showed:
- consistency of writing
- writing skills in various niches and of various lengths
- high engagement on my posts were a ‘real life demonstration’ of my work.

As a #fresher, this approach turned out to be the best.

Once the clients saw my published work, they knew I‘m serious about this. I would get deal confirmation calls the very next day!

What’s in your work portfolio?

"#British #Airways' safety information video is #AMAZING.

“Fasten your seatbelt when seated…”

It’s boring to hear this repeatedly on every aeroplane, isn’t it? We rarely take our headphones off or watch the crew during this announcement anymore.

All #flights have the same #message in their safety video.

But this one stuck with me.

In this video, we see 7 famous faces 'auditioning' for a role, while conveying safety messages in a super-engaging manner.

So… what did British Airways’ video do #different?

It went beyond the conventional.
It took the creative lane.
It brought in iconic celebrities.
It introduced humour and sarcasm.
It involved voice modulations.
It presented a casual body language.

Basically, it weaved a #story around repetitive information.

#Lesson?
Many people out there may do what you want to do.
But this is what it takes to stand out: be #creative and #unconventional.

Convey a simple message in an (emotionally) #impactful manner. Such things stick with people.

"""But... I don't have time to create #LinkedIn posts!""

I am often asked how I get the #time to create and share posts regularly. It can get difficult to be consistent on rough days, but I believe that it is all about #priorities, and making time for it.

This is how I create content on busy days:

1. Use #commute hours:
- I draft my post on the bus ride to college. I edit my post on my way back. When I walk to college, I record an audio of any ideas I get. I type it down when I get back home.

2. Create content in #advance:
- I jot down multiple content topics and ideas every day. Over the weekend, I craft various posts. Then, I only take out 2 mins to copy-paste the content and post!

3. Make the most of every #minute:
- I work on posts whenever I get a few minutes to myself— during lunch breaks, break between lectures, while waiting for the bus, waiting for my order at the cafe, anything at all!

So... when are you #writing your next post?

"Grown-ups often ask me, “What career will you have by studying English Literature?”
Students my age tell me, “You’re so lucky you’re pursuing your dreams!”

#English is a rather unconventional subject to study. #Writing is a rather unstable #career to pursue. But I am doing it. And my parents are funding it.

So... how did this ‘miracle’ happen?

Magic formula: By telling my parents that I wanted to #pursue Literature! And I did this 3 months before my XII board exams.

If I would have thought that ’it is too late to tell them’, I would be studying medicine now. Everything changed for me only because I told my #parents about it. Otherwise, how would they know what I really wanted?

(Psst… medicine was also my decision, but I realised I loved writing more.)

Today, in 2019, talking to your parents about your #passion is an important skill. #Persuading your parents to allow you to follow your passion is a more important skill.
That’s right; they are skills. Cultivate them.

This post is a reminder:
Don’t hesitate. Don’t hold back. Don’t overthink.
It is never too late to talk to your parents about your #dreams.

"Dear students and parents, #PLEASE #CONVERSE!

I understand it’s difficult to pursue what you really want, mainly due to:
1. #Peer #pressure
2. Unsurety
3. #Parental pressure

In case of...

1: Follow your passion, not your peers. Drop the herd mentality.

2: It’s completely okay to be unsure about what you want to #pursue! Making a major life decision at 15-ish is intimidating, and almost absurd. Give yourself a #break, and #explore your options. Remember: don’t be hard on yourself.

3: Talk to your #family about your dreams and passion. Converse. Tell them what you like, why you want to pursue it, how #dedicated you are to it, and what it would mean to you to get to do that.

I know that convincing parents is one of the most #difficult things to do. It is difficult to convince them that there is more to a (successful) career than #science and #commerce. But hey, you HAVE TO GIVE IT A SHOT!

Your #dreams deserve a #chance. Don’t block them yourself. #Talk to your parents.

Wishing you all the best of luck!

"Jet Airways lost my bag worth over INR 55,000. And now... I don't care.

Last December, I was flying back home, carrying gifts for my family and friends. When I landed, one of my bags was missing.

I was heartbroken; all my special presents were gone.

I called and emailed Jet Airways every single day for a month. I was very angry, and constantly followed up with them... until March. Then, I stopped.

I stopped because I am aware of what #Jet #Airways is going through.

I am aware of all those employees worried about their #jobs, their #salaries, and their #families. I am aware of all those employees troubled over when they will get their next job. I am aware of all those employees concerned about the #future of their #children.

My heart goes out to every single of the 16,000 employees whose lives are supported by Jet Airways.

I felt so hurt over losing one bag. Now, I cannot imagine the pain that all the #employees must be going through.

I am not sure how I can help them out. Maybe one less angry e-mail may offer someone some relief?

Hoping for the best for all those struggling right now. #Stay #strong.

"Did you know: 'Alot' is #not a word!

Every day I see comments saying ""thanks alot"", and I'm surprised when they are used even by #writers!

What is the #correct word?

""A lot""
- This means 'many'
- Eg., ""thanks a lot"", ""I had a lot of fun"", ""Your post helped me a lot""

""Allot""
- to give a certain amount
- Eg., ""I was allotted seat 47"", ""We're allotted 1 hour of break""

Other words which #sound #similar but have #different #meanings:
- Who's/ Whose
- There/ Their
- Except/ Accept
- Advice/ Advise
- Practice/ Practise

Do you know the difference in the above words? Do you know any more such words? #Comment below!

"“Sorry that my English is not good...”

If you apologise for your ‘poor’ English: #Stop! Do #NOT #apologise.

Yes. Do #NOT apologise.

⁉️ Why should you not apologise?

1. You appear less #confident
2. You make the reader look for #errors which may otherwise go unnoticed
3. You lessen the #impact of your message
4. You #annoy the reader.

‼️ What should you do instead?

1. Learn to #communicate better
2. Focus on #writing #skills and not just speaking
3. Put in #efforts to improve your English
4. Re-check every #sentence before you send a message.

Excuses and apologies won’t get you anywhere.
#Invest #time in yourself.

"Just back from my first #interview for a summer #internship. Didn’t crack this one.

I’ve been sharing all the ‘happy’ things and all the things that worked out for me. By sharing this, I want to let you know that not everything works out. By sharing this, I want to let you know that #social #media is all about the #success and the glamour; there’re more sides to life than what is double tapped and ‘liked’. By sharing this, I’m sharing a #reality #check. A reality check for myself as well.

The last few months have been amazing. I caught onto everything I wished for and worked for, and I couldn’t be more grateful for what I have.

But today is completely different. Today, strangely, I’m a tiny bit #grateful for #rejection. Because today, I realise that rejection is #important too. Rejection keeps you grounded.

"#Freshers! Work from #home, or work from #office?

We all talk about the benefits of working from home: flexible schedule, no travel, environment-friendly, comfortable, money saver....

Yet, I believe this discussion is #different for Freshers.

Work from office helped me develop:
1. #Professionalism
2. #Communication skills
3. #Confidence
(and so much more!)

Oh, and I am now learning Adobe #Illustrator, only because I learnt some basics from a #graphic #designer in my previous #internship! So yes, it sparks #interest too!

Do you think work from office is #important for freshers?

This is HOW MANY #attempts went into making my #first #vlog!! (Link in comment)

It was so exhausting..
🎥 looking for good #lighting
🎥 finding a suitable (and quiet) background,
🎥 speaking only the #relevant things,
🎥 #holding the #camera at a good angle,
and what not!

(I found good lighting, and then got distracted by a mini photoshoot haha!)

#YES, I made it through!

#Lesson #learnt!
Sometimes, you have to just #DO things. You can figure out the aesthetics later. The most #important #step is to #begin (and I’m glad I did!).

"A few weeks ago, I wrote about how I #moved #on from an interview.
(Link in comments)

Before I decide to move on, I take two steps #after any #interview:

1. #Email a ‘Thank You’
I write an email to the company #thanking them for the interview, specify which part of our #conversation I liked the most, and ask them to #contact me for any further questions. Such an email makes interviewees #memorable, and may sway any neck-to-neck decisions the interviewer is making.

2. Await a response, #follow #up after said-date
If I haven’t heard back from the company after the said-date, I email them a #reminder. If I don't get a response soon, I follow this up with a #call. If I don't hear back after multiple attempts, I simply #move #on.

Interviews take immense #efforts to catch hold of, and even more so to #crack. It gets draining to let go of #opportunities we think we had. But it's always better to use our #time and #energy working for the #next #interview.

The important thing is to not give up.
Keep approaching companies, be #persistent, and improve your #pitch every time.

The trick is to keep #learning and #keep #going!

"""Looking for an #opportunity""? You're doing it #WRONG!

Every day, I see many profiles with the #LinkedIn #headline:
""Looking for job #change""
""#Open to opportunities""
""#Actively #looking for opportunities""

If this is your headline, you're #MISSING #OUT on opportunities!
Why? Because you are not specific!

Instead, #write:
""#Experienced Data Analyst available for new opportunities""
""Recent Chemical Engineering #Graduate seeking job""
""Former Retail Manager, #seeking Executive role""

Follow this up with a #punchline about #yourself!
Eg.: ""Customer-focused #pro with #excellent #sales records.""

Most importantly: Be #specific!

#Attract #recruiters with your headline! #STAND #OUT!!

Good luck!

"I now support my own monthly expenses in #Dublin, thanks to #LinkedIn.

My first post on LinkedIn went #viral. It garnered 1.5 #million #views and 14,000+ likes. (Link in comment)

After that post, I got messages from various people, asking me to #write for them. That’s how I got my two big #clients, back in November.

Since then, I’ve worked with numerous people, on all sorts of #projects— big and small.

That’s the #power of #LinkedIn. And that’s the power of #content #creation.

I #never #promoted myself.
I never spoke of my #services.
#People (like you) #read my posts, read my stories, #liked my work, and #approached me to write for them. Only because I #shared #content.

I suggest you all to #harness #this #power.
Share content.
It’s not just about content writers anymore. #Share what you #do, what you #love; your #stories, #failures, and #accomplishments.
Keep sharing.

"‘Hands down while speaking!’

I was just back to school after a global level debate #competition in #Singapore.

I was called out during my #school assembly to #share my #experience with the other #students, a crowd of over 100. I got up and took the mic.

While I spoke, I held the mic in my #left hand, moving my #right hand around in sync with my words. A teacher walked up to me, took the mic, gave it in my right hand, and placed my left hand behind my back.

I was rather #surprised. (And also embarrassed; I was talking about my experience of public speaking in a debate competition!)

That day, I learnt something very important:
#Not all #advice is #correct advice. Not all advice is #good advice.

If you’ve been asked to keep your hands down straight while #speaking, think it over.

Here are 5 #reasons you should #use your #hands while #talking:
1. Grabs #attention
2. Helps you #speak #clear and #align your #thoughts
3. Develops #imagination for the viewer (and yourself!)
4. Creates a #visual #aid through the movement
5. Makes you seem #welcoming and #trustworthy.

So, use your hands; #don’t #hide your gestures.
Let your hands guide you as you speak!

What’s your view on this?

P.s. there may be some situational exceptions.

"LinkedIn NEEDS a Plagiarism Checker!

Lately, I’ve been so #worried about the content I’m posting on #LinkedIn.

The posts I share are my own stories. Also, my LinkedIn is now my #work #portfolio. How do I #trust my work to always remain only mine if anyone can claim it as their own?

How can an anti-plagiarism #system work?

— If X posts something copied, then X must get a #warning from LinkedIn within 48 hours
— X cannot #hide the name of content creator in the post to say “I gave #credit”, while creating the illusion that the post is theirs
— If X does not #clarify this issue within the next 48 hours, the post must be taken #down
— If this is repeated by X, LinkedIn must take #strict #action against the account of X.

This is a #NEED. Today, millions of people are using LinkedIn as a platform to #craft and #share #original #content. We NEED content #security.

If LinkedIn can connect me to like-minded people, I’m sure it can detect #copied, #plagiarised content. Why not have a plagiarism checker in the LinkedIn #algorithm?

Can we have this on LinkedIn please?

"Last year, my friend went to a #gym for a one-day #trial. And she never went back.

She'd never worked out a day in her life. She was offered a trial with a #professional #trainer.

This is what she was asked to do on her first day:
- 30 mins on the treadmill
- 30 squats
- 30 push-ups
- 30 crunches
- Lift 5kg dumbbells each.

She managed to pull through this intense first day by her trainer’s “words of #motivation”.

The next day, she couldn’t get out of bed. Her entire body #hurt; she couldn’t even sit up straight. She felt exhausted and #afraid.

That was her #first #workout #ever. It's like asking a primary student to solve algebra— of course the kid is going to hate school!

The excuse people give for not going to the gym is lack of time. In reality, I feel that their experience was so bad & painful, and the soreness & pain affects their routine life so adversely, that they just avoid gyms.

So, what should gyms do to #get & #retain #clients?
- #Understand it’s just day one
- Introduce clients to #fitness, not make them “master” it
- Develop #interest and #love for fitness
- Make clients want to #come #back for more!

If you want clients, understand them & work #for them. A free trial isn’t going to get you clients, your #compassion towards them is.

"I reviewed CVs this week!

It was so amazing to see how creative and skilled you all are! Most of you nailed the content, and had such awesome CVs! Well done, everyone!

Here are my basic suggestions w.r.t. common errors I found:

1. Keep it only one page long!
2. Use a consistent font. Make it bold or italic as required.
3. The layout must be simple and well-aligned. Don't confuse the reader!
4. Don’t ignore these sections:
-- Short personal summary
-- Soft skills
-- Hobbies/ Interests
-- Personal projects (if any)
-- Volunteering (if any)
5. Personalise your #LinkedIn url! Remove all those numbers from the link, keep it neat, and update it in your CV
6. Spellcheck, spellcheck, spellcheck!
7. Know the difference: its/ it’s, there/their, then/ than
8. Be creative, but don’t make it uncomfortable to read
9. Explain everything! How, why, when, what, how many, what percent… use numbers
10. No (unnecessary) short forms!

I hope this helps you improve your #CV!

P.s. you can still send me your CV for #feedback with msg “CV Feedback Request”. I recommend making the above changes before sharing it with me!

"Have you ever left the lid on your pot for too long while cooking?

What happens then?
The water #bubbles #over.

Next?
It #falls #all #over the stove.

Next?
It creates a #complete #mess.

So, what’s the lesson here?

If you live your life with a lid on, you’ll create a mess.
If you always repress yourself, you’ll create a mess.

Be open to #creativity.
Be open to #knowledge.
Be open to #learning.

Step outside your #comfort #zone.
Give yourself a #break.

"Looking for CV feedback?

I commented on a post 2 days back that asked for #CV #feedback. Since then, my comment has received 30+ likes, and I’ve received multiple requests for CV feedback. (Link to my answer in first comment)

The feedback has turned out to help a lot of people, so if you’re someone who wants help:
- #message me a pdf of your CV
- with first line of msg: “CV Feedback Request”

Few key points about CVs:
1. Best as a #one-#pager
2. Your job descriptions should be #numeric
- talk about time, number of people, percentages, etc
- eg., “led a team of 20”, “successfully completed a 45-day project in 37 days”, “saved the team 7% revenue by making xyz changes”
3. Keep it eco-friendly. Use basic, minimal colours so that it’s #eco-#friendly & economical to print
4. #Spelling #errors and short-forms are a big #NO
5. Try novoresume(.com) to create simple, one-page CVs

Please note:
My feedback is basic, in terms of spelling, vocabulary, sentence formation, layout and overall aesthetic of the CV.

Rules:
Be patient. I’ll reply to all messages.

P.s. if I’ve given you feedback, please leave a comment of how it helped you!

"Papa-Beti #Story #Time!

I was naturally inclined towards #books & #storytelling, thanks to my dad's massive library & very apparent #reading time.

My #first letters were sneaked under his #door in #pink envelopes; ”Dear #dad, please get me a phone. I #love you.. (adults are also kids only, so I can have a phone)”.

When I was 6, we’d go to a book #store, get a new Tintin comic & then mango ice-cream.

Every #Saturday we'd #rent a dvd & #watch it over the #weekend with a glass of #pepsi.

While #driving, we spoke of where the mountain went; while reading out billboards. We‘d #predict how the car in front of us would drive next, & my dad would look at me with a ‘I told you so’ glance.

In simple ways, such #small stories have #influenced how I see the #world. It’s #taught me that if you read enough and are #aware, you can find an #explanation for #everything.

The world is #predictable, and so are its #people; you must only #learn to #observe.

Thank you, Dad!
Shreekant Pattar

P.s. the pic is from ‘The Good Dinosaur’. The #papa 🦕 says to the #baby 🦕, “You are me, and more”. During this scene, my dad & me both screamed “THAT’S US!”

"“Dad, I do #NOT want to study #science. I want to study #English #Literature”

At 10, I wanted to be a veterinarian.
At 13, an ophthalmologist.
At 15, I studied science to prepare for #NEET.

Finally, 2 months before my 12th #boards, I said:
“Dad, I want to #study literature.”

I got a lot of #questions from #everyone else:
😱 Are you gonna #fail boards? So you’re choosing #arts?
😱 Don't want to take a drop after failing NEET?
😱 Science to literature???
😱 What's to study in #English? Are you not good at it?
😱 What #career lies in English?

Beyond every question, my #favourite #response was that of my #dad:
""Okay. #Prepare for your SAT.”

There was #never a #second #thought.
My dad believed in me.
He said to me, “Shreyu, you can do whatever you like. I really think you should #pursue literature.”

I’m thankful for his eternal #support, #love & #mentoring. I’m thankful that he never doubted my #choices and #decisions.

My dad is the reason I could #confidently switch to pursue literature overnight. And I’m #thankful for such an understanding #father and loving #family, every single day.

Thanks dad! Shreekant Pattar

"“Dad, how can he #crack #interviews?”

Someone messaged me on #LinkedIn a month ago. He was #unable to crack interviews to get a good #job. He was a #fresher, who lacked enough #experience to start a job.

I spoke to him; helped as much as I could.

Then, I shared his #number with my #dad.

The next day, I woke up to a long “thank you” message from the person, saying my dad had called him and helped him #understand what to #do.

That’s what my dad always does.
He #helps. He #mentors.

The best part is: he helps & mentors #everyone he can.

So, you can #contact my dad, Shreekant Pattar, if you‘re:
• unable to close #deals
• #looking for a job as a fresher
• #trying to #raise #funding
• failing to crack interviews
• aiming to #develop basic #skills (communication)
• learning to #pitch
• full of #questions!

Message my dad Shreekant Pattar for help!

Follow his directions; you are bound to #succeed.

Read the #recommendations on his page to know for yourself. 
Go ahead: connect, #follow and message Shreekant Pattar

"“Dad, I was #selected for the internship last week, and now they say I am #NOT”

I‘d been to an #interview in Churchgate. I was asked to join from the next week, saying I would receive the #offer letter by email.

A whole week went by.

I finally called the company. The receptionist said, “The selections have been done. You are not selected.” She hung up.

She didn’t ask me my name.
She didn’t ask me when I’d given the interview.
She didn’t wait for my response.

I was shocked. And immensely disappointed.

I went up to my dad, and ranted to him about the whole situation. I screamed about the unprofessionalism, immorality and indecency of the company.

My dad’s reply?
“#Move #on”

I stared at my dad furiously.

The next day, I stopped thinking of the failed situation. I #started #applying for #new internships and emailing new people. I finally got an #amazing #offer, from Times Now.

Everyone talks about #moving #on from people and #relationships. Moving on from #interviews is equally #important.
If you don’t move on, how will you date again? I mean… how will you find a new #opportunity?

Thanks for this lesson, dad.

"I spent Rs.4,800 on #contact #lenses.

I used to wear lenses only during outings or to parties, since I found them uncomfortable for #daily wear.

When I brought the new lenses home, this is what my #dad said:

“Why wear lenses only for outings and with #other #people? You should be able to either wear only lenses, or wear only specs every single day. You should not change yourself for certain occasions or certain people. Be 100% comfortable in specs, or 100% comfortable in lenses. #Always #be #comfortable with yourself.”

The next day, I returned the lenses.

It’s been a #year.
I haven’t worn lenses since.

Although it seems simple, this was a very #important #lesson for me. Over time, it gave me an improving sense of #comfort and #confidence. It is also less stressful — now I don’t have to think whether I want to wear lenses or specs— there’s no option!

#Big #lessons hide in #small #situations.
I’m thankful to my dad for showing me how to learn from them.

Thanks dad!

"“Think Trinity”

These two words were the first two words I came across at a #University fair last year.

I stared at the brochure for a bit, while the representative explained about the Uni.

Honestly, the entire narration was very intimidating. While listening, I gave up the idea of applying here. I was so certain there was no point in hoping to get into such a college, that I decided to not try at all.

I came home with a bunch of brochures and my mom went through them. She opened this one & saw the word ‘reputation’ and said, “This is where you are going”. (It had nothing to do with the Uni, it’s more of a Taylor Swift thing!) I simply laughed it off; it was silly to think of going here.

Finally, after lots of back & forth, I forwarded my application to the #college. Three weeks later, this miracle happened:-
New email:
#Congratulations, Trinity College Dublin is delighted to #offer you a place...

That is when I realised what the two words meant.

Think.
Think of what you want.
Think of showing up for it.
Think of working for it.
Think of achieving it.

That's where everything starts: in the way you think.
The more it runs in your mind, the more it evolves into you believing it.

And then, you will #do #your #best to have it.

Always #THINK.

"""CANDIDATES SHOULD RECEIVE FEEDBACK AFTER INTERVIEWS""

Many people post (and repost) about wanting confirmation after job interviews, even if they are rejected.

The SAME PEOPLE ASK QUERIES for my services, say ""I'll get back to you"", and then NEVER RESPOND!!

WHY THIS #HYPOCRISY?

If you have a concern, #ASK!
> ""Our budget is xyz, can you suit our price?""
> ""Can you produce pqr content every x days?""
> ""Do you accept payment in INR?""
> ""Can you share some previous work?""

If it's a no, BE HONEST!
> ""Unfortunately, we won't be continuing with you""
> ""We've found someone else for the project""

PLEASE BE COMPASSIONATE AND REPLY!

P.s. people who reply regularly, speak properly and explain their requirements in detail are the ones who will stick with you, pay on time, and truly value your work. Thankfully, I have had some sincere queries on #LinkedIn, who have turned into very loyal and very happy clients!

"~ Why Having No Opinion is the Best Opinion to Have ~

Right from ""apple or android?"" to ""Nicki Minaj or Cardi B?"", our life is full of opinions. In a world where we are 'entitled' to our opinion, is it okay to not have one at all?

"IF YOU HAD ALL THE RESOURCES IN THE WORLD, HOW WOULD YOU TACKLE #HOMELESSNESS?

> Bill Gates' foundation, Gates Foundation, pledged $158 million to fight poverty in U.S.
> Finland launched a scheme called Housing First and gave permanent homes to the homeless on a normal lease.
> NYC’s permanent supportive housing model combined affordable housing assistance with support services for individuals living with illness and health problems.

Homelessness can be caused by multiple factors:
1. Broken housing system- shortage of properties, high rent, etc
2. Lack of job and money
3. Addiction to drugs & alcohol
4. Poor mental health and relationships

I want to know from YOU.

Comment: How would YOU solve this problem? What steps would you take right now, to tackle homelessness?

"Taylor Swift's latest article for ELLE Magazine is a must-read!

My top takeaways:

1. ""I think it’s healthy for your self-esteem to need less internet praise to appease it""

2. ""Be like a snake—only bite if someone steps on you.""

3. ""Trying and failing and trying again and failing again is normal""

4. ""Be discerning""

5. ""We have to live bravely in order to truly feel alive, and that means not being ruled by our greatest fears""

6. ""It was an important lesson for me to learn to have my OWN value system of what I actually want.""

7. ""Apologizing when you have hurt someone who really matters to you takes nothing away from you""

8. ""Even if you can’t really help the situation, it’s nice for them to know that you would if you could""

9. ""It’s important to address our long-standing issues before we turn into the living embodiment of them""

10. ""No one is a mind reader... verbalize how you feel""

11. ""Step into the daylight and let it go.""

"~ Tips (or hacks!) for student life ~

It’s been 6 months since I started Uni!
6 months since I moved away from home.
6 months since I’ve been waking up without my dad pulling me out of bed. (Last one is most difficult!)

Well, everything got easier with every passing day. I managed daily commute, falling sick, exam stress, cooking (check out last post for an example), meeting assignment deadlines... everything.

Here’s a list of little things I’ve learnt to live by as a student:

1. Follow your instincts!!
2. Be responsible, strong and aware
3. Never skip breakfast. Cook a proper meal. Health comes first
4. Wear comfortable shoes; be prepared for an unexpectedly long day
5. Set the bed every morning. Coming back to a neat bed is bliss
6. Never go grocery shopping on an empty stomach (you’ll end up buying unnecessary things)
7. Wash dishes instantly. The longer you leave them dirty, the harder they are to clean
8. Clean laundry creates happiness (nothing like having fresh, flower-scented clothes!)
9. Cleaning the room/ kitchen can be therapeutic (I get it now, mom!)
10. Save money. Track your budget & expenses.

What are your tips? Comment!

"This is how I serve food for myself!

I love cooking. Back at home, I'd cook often for my family, and arrange the food beautifully on a fancy dish.

Now, I cook for myself. I eat by myself. Yet, I plate my food properly even though no one looks at it (sometimes my Instagram does, duh).

Why do I still plate my food nicely?
~ I love cooking, and I like doing it the right way no matter who’s looking. I believe that things that look good tend to feel good and actually be good.

Why make the efforts when it’s only for myself?
~ A beautiful plate makes me happy, and allows me to appreciate my food better. The efforts aren’t for someone to see; they are for me to enjoy!

Lesson?
If you love something, do your best no matter who’s looking. Always stand out doing the things you love.

If you love make-up, put on your best winged eyeliner, even if it's only at home!
If you love singing, sing your best, even if it’s only in your bathroom!
If you love writing, write the best email, even if it’s only a product complaint!

Do what you love. And DO IT BEST!

Thank you, Brian Brandt, for making me realise the importance of doing my best for the things I love. It’s a gem of an advice!

"It’s 3:29 am. I’m a 💡!

It is 3:29 am, and this picture from last week describes exactly what I’m going through right now: being a lightbulb💡!!

1 am. I hit the bed.
1:30 am. I finally keep my phone after scrolling through emails & social media.
2:30 am. I’m wide awake as ideas and thoughts keep churning in my mind for hours.

It’s really strange when I can’t get any sleep because of all that’s running in my head. I’m truly a lightbulb at night: ideas for my essays, plans for the week, regrets for my mistakes, theories for the next Taylor Swift album, and reminders for my deadlines keep rolling around in me.

What’s bad about this is how irregular and incoherent my thoughts are at this time; constantly overlapping and taking away any possible chance of a peaceful sleep. Invariably, I end up picking my phone and writing these down, losing further sleep.

Looking forward to my mind taking a break (or choosing to not fall asleep during the day).

Have you ever lost sleep thanks to being preoccupied?
How do you get through this?

"What is an IDEA? (a mini philosophy crash course!!)

As per these philosophers…

Descartes: Ideas are intellectual forms of the divine mind, not the brain

Hobbes: Ideas are purely images coming into the brain from the outside

Locke: Ideas come from experience. There are no innate ideas, only what we gain from observation.

"Reminder: you can stop reading that book halfway!

I would often continue reading books I didn't like or understand, only because I had started them, and I HAD to finish them.

Don't commit that mistake. Don’t finish a book because ‘you should’. Finish a book because you want to.
If you find the book is not working for you, simply move on to a different one.
[Don't do this for academics, people!]

There’s only so much time you have in a day. Spend it on reading what you like, what interests you and what helps you grow!

Happy Reading!

"I‘m SO disappointed by #unpaid #internships:
1. Beneficial? Of course!
2. Moral? Still seeking an answer.

The facts:
1. #Interns are the MOST dynamic, dedicated & resourceful people in a #company
2. Little #experience, or lack thereof does reap HUGE benefits to the company
3. #Paid internships support monthly #expenses of students like us
4. Today, every student has a KICKASS #SKILL [P.s. you get to learn that skill!].

If YOU are ready to #hire interns, it is because YOU NEED INTERNS! This means, YOU are a thriving #brand who needs interns to create a cutting-edge #team that can lead YOU to the top. It’s sad to see you shy away from appreciating hard work.

So, here's what employers should do:
1. Understand the facts
2. Hire interns you require
3. Know the intern's power skills
4. USE & help build on these power skills
5. #PAY INTERNS FOR THEIR HARD WORK!

This isn't about me; I've been lucky enough to be compensated for my efforts. This is about all those who've to give in to such #offers because of their eagerness to #learn.

To you & to all companies who offer unpaid internships, please #change this practice.

To put it simply, work is work. And work must be rewarded.
We don’t ask you for free services. Please don’t ask us for unpaid #efforts.

Sincerely,
All the Hustlers.

"This book proves that you don't need long sentences & big words to create good content; you need a meaningful story. 
I just finished reading ‘Normal People’, a fictional love story set in Trinity College, by alumni Sally Rooney.

The book unveils the human psyche. The pages explore a superb blend of love, anxiety, miscommunication, vulnerability, rawness, hurt, risk & societal pressures. Rooney takes multiple steps beyond romance to address differences in socioeconomic backgrounds & various political impacts.
I loved the characters of Marianne and Connell— 2 intelligent teens who, like most of us, know what they love, but aren't certain where it will lead them. 
My favourite lines from the book are:
> ""She believes Marianne lacks ‘warmth’, by which she means the ability to beg for love from people who hate her.""

> ""Life is the thing you bring with you inside your own head.""

> ""It's funny the decisions you make because you like someone, he says, and then your whole life is different. I think we're at that weird age where life can change a lot from small decisions.""

Rooney is an outstanding writer, with a unique eye for the world. Looking forward to more brilliant books by her!

"My latest article is live on the Trinity Business Review blog!

I share my story of meeting the CEO of LinkedIn, Jeff Weiner, and how I eventually became a part of LinkedIn as the Campus Editor for Trinity.

The Trinity Business Review (TBR) is a student-run online magazine; a bridge that connects undergraduates, graduates and working professionals to the latest business developments in country.
I write for ""Inside Track"", one of the four elements of TBR. My articles focus on personal insights and tips & tricks for surviving and growing in the professional world as a student, that you will not find elsewhere.


By writing about LinkedIn, I aim to motivate students to be active on the platform and share their stories, ideas and experiences, and most importantly, make #studentvoices heard!

"-How an ‘Attractive’ Goal Helped Achieve an Important Goal-

Entering college today had a surprise of its own— I was walking on a path of stone, alongside a line of COINS!
I heard someone shout, “Get the coin line to the Campanile!” [Campanile= Trinity’s iconic bell tower, seen in end of the video].

I walked past it at first, but then I went back to help the coin line make it to the Campanile faster! So,

— What‘s unique here?
The new ‘goal’ took a step beyond charity buckets. It entered the minds of passersby & created a fascination, “Will the coin line make it to the Campanile?”.
This eventually lead to a need for a positive answer & almost necessitated people to make the line longer.

— Why did it work?
The Campanile cannot be missed by tourists & students alike. By weaving the story around the landmark, people’s attention was drawn to a rather ‘interesting’ & ‘entertaining’ agenda, motivating them to donate.

— What did I learn?
1. Be unique, stand out
2. Weave a story around people & the things that amaze them
3. Develop an interest in people; lead them to take action.

What do you think about this approach?

"3 Essentials for an Impressive LinkedIn Profile

Don't overlook these when building your profile:

1. Profile picture
- Use a clear, professional image as your profile picture. Keep it natural & don't over-edit it. Avoid selfies, group pictures & filters. If you don’t have a good picture, simply stand in front of a non distracting wall and get it clicked by your friend! Most importantly, make sure the profile picture looks like you!

2. Cover photo
- Don’t overlook this super useful tool! Upload a cover picture that describes your company or your niche or you. This one photo can summarise your entire profile by itself.
Thank you ☁Shontel Burke-Clarke for this awesome tip!

3. Summary
- Use the summary section! Your profile needs an introduction, so use all 2000 characters to talk about you. Share a story or experience to make it interesting. Use headings, subheadings & keywords. Write in bullet points to make it easy to read!

Complete your profile, fill in the important details, and update these 3 things for an amazing profile!

"3 Tips for getting a LinkedIn Recommendation

1. Request one!
- To get a recommendation, you must ASK for it! Contact your bosses/ colleagues/ clients etc requesting a LinkedIn recommendation, and also provide them a direct link to make it simple. And make sure you thank them in advance!

2. Highlight key points
- Be specific about what you want the recommender to focus on. This way, you can showcase your strengths & skills more effectively.

3. Ask for corrections
- Your recommendations reflect on you beyond the message. If you see a spelling or punctuation error in the recommendation, don’t hesitate to ask for corrections.

Always strategise your recommendations to your benefit. Make them work for you the way YOU want them to.

Bonus:
1. Use the “Ask to Be Recommended Feature”
2. Write a recommendation for the recommender too.

Good luck!

"3 (FUN) Ways to Improve English:

1. Read, read, read
- Read books, especially classics, to understand how to frame sentences, appropriately use vocabulary, spell correctly, write cohesively, break paragraphs, use punctuation & grammar.
- To develop the habit of reading, start with newspapers/ journals/ magazines at first, eventually move to books.
- Make sure you increase your reading speed & volume every day— push yourself!

2. Watch English movies & listen to English songs
- While doing these, pay special attention to the pronounciation of the words. Follow the tone, pauses, choice of words, stress on sound etc.
- Referring subtitles & lyrics will help you initially. This is also a good way to understand different accents.

3. Think, converse & write in English
- That’s right! Think in English & you will soon start to speak it out loud. Speak to your friends & family in English as well, noticing their use of the language.
-Write more— journal your day, write emails & texts — but avoid ‘SMS’ language.
- Always write complete sentences to avoid future trouble with spellings, grammar, punctuation, etc.

And of course, ENJOY THE PROCESS!

What are your thoughts on ways to improve English?

"“But… what do I write about?”

If you’re a student asking yourself this question, here it is:

What do you write about?
Simple. WRITE ABOUT YOU!

Write about what you know. What you did. Who you met. Where you went.

Write about missing the bus.
Write about failing your test.
Write about excelling your exam.
Write about your friends & trips.
Write about college life, hostel life.
Write about pulling an all-nighter to complete your essay.
Write about time management & not procrastinating.
Write about your roles in various college societies.
Write about moving away & adapting to the real world.
Write about your interviews & internships.
Write about what you learnt in the last lecture.
Write about what made the class laugh in your last lecture!
Write about what you‘re writing an assignment on.
Write about your career goals & progress.
Write about your side hobbies & how you‘re harnessing them.

Bottom line— share stories. Someone else may find value in your experiences!
P.s., the more you write, the more new topics you’ll come up with!

So, what’s your next post going to be about?

"3 things I Learnt from 3 Months of College Life:

1. The true meaning of “College life is the best part of your life"" 
- College life is misunderstood as best for ‘having fun, making friends and partying’. But, college life is truly best because of the lessons it teaches, foundations it sets and doors it opens for me. I can decide my own definition of ‘best’ and choose what to do with these crucial years.

2. Things won’t happen for me. I have to make them happen
- Trinity College Dublin provides multiple opportunities in the form of events, contests, meetings, societal roles, campaigns etc. But these things only matter if I choose to participate in them. It’s not about what the college can do for me, it’s all about how I make the most of it.

3. The society & world don’t owe me anything
- I could be an Editor for multiple student societies, a topper, a scholar or an all-rounder. But these don't guarantee me an internship or job or success or money or fame. Outside the campus, it’s a whole new world and I am a whole new person.

What did your college life teach you?

"- Four Lessons I Learnt on a Bus -

The lady in the brown hat climbed the bus and sat next to the lady in the black hat.
As soon as she sat down, she turned to her and said, “I like your hat!”.
The lady in the black hat instantly smiled the happiest smile and exclaimed, “Thank you!!”.

For the next 15 minutes, the ladies shared their hat stories— where they got it, why they like hats, what people have said about it.

Finally, when the lady in the brown hat got down the bus, she looked back at the other lady and waved with a wide smile.

Here’s what I learnt in those 15 minutes:
1. You like something? Appreciate it.
2. Making someone happy is as simple as saying “I like your hat”
3. Making a friend is also as simple as saying “I like your hat”!
4. Start conversing with one line. Connections will happen. Stories will follow.

"- The Ebbinghaus Illusion -

We were discussing the Ebbinghaus Illusion (in pic) in my philosophy class. Suddenly, our professor said, ‘Not sure what you can do with this information, but it is what it is!’ The entire class laughed. I stopped laughing halfway. And in that flash of a second, I knew what my next post would be.

Look at the image below.
Which orange circle looks bigger? Right?

But, both orange circles are of the SAME SIZE!

What happened here?
The grey circles changed our perspective. Our brain compared the orange to the grey circles outside, processed these visual differences & caused us to find the right orange circle bigger.

The things in life are also similar.

Imagine this:
Orange circle- our goal.
Grey circles- our struggles.

When we've small problems: we see our goals BIG & IMPORTANT (& easy to achieve). So we continue to work hard.
When we've big problems: our goals appear small. So we give up on our goal.
Our obstacles, issues, bad times— they change the importance of our goals & dreams.

In reality, the worth of our ambition is the same.
In reality, both the orange circles are the same.

So, moral of the story?
Don’t let obstacles lessen the importance of your dream. Keep going.

Thoughts?

"- Key Aspects of Writing I Learnt with Time (and from my Dad!) -

1. Tell a story 
We all love stories, because that’s what makes any writing personal & relatable. It makes the text interesting, engaging & easy to read.

2. Invoke senses, evoke emotion
We all tend to remember things by our senses and the emotions something made us feel. I’ve learnt that to be memorable, any writing must be touching, moving & thought-provoking.

3. Use metaphors
If anything works best for writing, it is imagery. Metaphors engage the senses. The use of metaphors lets one show a creative & knowledgable side of themselves, while keeping the reader engrossed & involved.

4. Keep it cohesive
Every line of a paragraph should connect with the next, and with also with the line of the next paragraph. Cohesion gives the writing a flow & keeps the imagination running smoothly, in a sequence.

5. Work on it
Wrote it? Now, edit edit edit! Every piece of writing needs to be worked upon. Be it checking the spelling, grammar, vocabulary, or giving it a complete makeover— editing is the longest, final & most important step of writing. Editing takes time & one must give it time.

What are your writing tips?

Happy Writing!

This is a guest blog I wrote for Michael Neuendorff, PCC, about my interaction with the CEO of LinkedIn, what I learnt from him, and why we need compassion in business.

Then I saw— LinkedIn’s CEO Jeff Weiner had replied to my post.

And that one reply has changed my life for the better by giving me:

I connected with over 1000 people & received 100s of comments from across the globe— Ireland, Singapore, the States, Peru, Milan, & more!

2. Helpful connections
I received advice on building my profile & was connected with experts in my field. Many thanks to ☁Shontel Burke-Clarke, William De Smet, Dinneen Grably, Elliot Waterhouse, Mira Ruder-Hook, Nirajita Banerjee.

3. Work connections They got me job referrals & meetings which have opened new doors for me. I've received many offers to write as a copywriter & guest writer. Thank you Michael Neuendorff, PCC, Gabriel P., Brian Brandt.

"- Writing Lessons to Myself -

It’s been 3 weeks since I shared my experience with LinkedIn's CEO Jeff Weiner. Post that, I started crafting articles, checking post statistics, replying to comments— never thought I’d do this for anything other than Instagram!

In the past few days, I’ve received many messages on how to start writing.

Here’s my story:

1. I write for myself
Writing has always been my natural way of expressing. I write to share my stories, and I see that people like them!

2. I begin
At times, I sit with a messy idea for hours, other times I’m lazy. Then, I give myself a goal of 150 words. By the time I stop, I’ve churned out over 600!

3. I’m consistent
I write everyday— be it poems, rants or blogs. At first, I scribbled 1 page a day for months; now I see the change. Recently, my writing has been purely replying to LinkedIn posts, and even this has created a world of difference!

4. I read more
If my dad were to write this post, he would recommend Charles Dickens’ books for their vivid characterisation. Now that I read numerous texts for college, I realise reading helps achieve structure, cohesion & fluency in writing.

Like any endeavour, writing is difficult in the start.
Because it is the start— how can it not be?

So I write. Everyday.
Happy Writing!

"Marley & Me’s Author &.. Me!

I peeped through the door of the cozy library where John Grogan was sitting. He saw me & waved me in with a smile. We got conversing about the weather (it’s not small talk in Dublin!), home sickness, making friends, my dreams & studies. I told John I love writing & dogs. And his book ‘Marley & Me’ brought out the perfect mix of both!
“Honestly, I read your book b’coz your tagline angered me. I mean, why would anyone label a dog as the world’s worst dog?! But, now, I think that was an amazing copywriting move!”, I told John.
We talked about the book, about John’s life & wife, & of course, Marley. Amongst these talks, I shared the recent loss of our dog & how inconsolable my sister was. I instantly recognised the look in his eye, of grief & sorrow, one that I’d seen in my sister too.
I asked John for a note to my sister. And then, John did one of the most humane acts ever- he took the effort to write down her name on another page, so that he could get it correct on the note.
We then took a picture together. I was pleasantly surprised he was going on a date with his wife. I left with a happy thanks.

The 30 mins with John taught me humility & responsibility. Most importantly, I learnt of unconditional love & unwavering loyalty.

"~ When the CEO of LinkedIn Jeff Weiner himself checked my LinkedIn Profile ~

The interview ended, I stepped out, where Jeff Weiner was cheerfully speaking to students, getting pictures clicked. I walked up to him, got my picture clicked, & stood back.

After admiring him from a distance, I walked up to him again,
“Hey Jeff, my name is Shreya. I’d like to know how I, as a student, can make the most of my LinkedIn. Don’t want to wait till I graduate.”
“Okay, so what do you do, tell me about you.”
“I write. I’m a copy writer.”
“Do you have a LinkedIn profile?”
“Yes.”
“Can I see it?”
(In my head, “It’s literally all yours”)

I brightened up the screen, handed my phone over to Jeff. He went through my entire page. He asked me what my dream job is, where I would like to work. He told me where I should start. He never broke eye contact & was so firm & promising with what he said.
We spoke for about 3 minutes, during which his interest and enthusiasm was remarkable.

In his interview, he’d spoken of compassion- why it is greater than empathy, why it is important in leadership.
And I am certain that there is no other person who is more worthy of speaking of compassion than this man right here.
It was an honour to meet you, Jeff.
Hope to see you again soon!
